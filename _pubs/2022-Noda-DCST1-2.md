abstract: "The process of sperm-egg fusion is critical for successful fertilization, yet the underlying
mechanisms that regulate these steps have remained unclear in vertebrates. Here, we show
that both mouse and zebrafish DCST1 and DCST2 are necessary in sperm to fertilize the egg,
similar to their orthologs SPE-42 and SPE-49 in C. elegans and Sneaky in D. melanogaster.
Mouse Dcst1 and Dcst2 single knockout (KO) sperm are able to undergo the acrosome
reaction and show normal relocalization of IZUMO1, an essential factor for sperm-egg fusion,
to the equatorial segment. While both single KO sperm can bind to the oolemma, they show
the fusion defect, resulting that Dcst1 KO males become almost sterile and Dcst2 KO males
become sterile. Similar to mice, zebrafish dcst1 KO males are subfertile and dcst2 and dcst1/2
double KO males are sterile. Zebrafish dcst1/2 KO sperm are motile and can approach the
egg, but are defective in binding to the oolemma. Furthermore, we find that DCST1 and
DCST2 interact with each other and are interdependent. These data demonstrate that
DCST1/2 are essential for male fertility in two vertebrate species, highlighting their crucial
role as conserved factors in fertilization."
