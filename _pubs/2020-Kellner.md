abstract: "Global efforts to combat the Covid-19 pandemic caused by the beta coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 are
currently based on RT-qPCR-based diagnostic tests. However, their high cost, moderate throughput
and reliance on sophisticated equipment limit widespread implementation. Loop-mediated
isothermal amplification after reverse transcription (RT-LAMP) is an alternative detection method
that has the potential to overcome these limitations. Here we present a rapid, robust, highly
sensitive and versatile RT-LAMP based SARS-CoV-2 detection assay. Our forty-minute procedure
bypasses a dedicated RNA isolation step, is insensitive to carry-over contamination, and uses a
hydroxynaphthol blue (HNB)-based colorimetric readout, which allows robust SARS-CoV-2
detection from various sample types. Based on this assay we have substantially increased sensitivity
and scalability by a simple nucleic acid enrichment step (bead-LAMP), established a pipette-free
version for home testing (HomeDip-LAMP), and developed a version with open source enzymes
that could be produced in any molecular biology setting. Our advanced, universally applicable RTLAMP
assay is a major step towards population-scale SARS-CoV-2 testing."
