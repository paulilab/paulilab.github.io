abstract: "tRNA genes exist in multiple copies in the genome of all organisms across the three domains of life. Besides the sequence differences across tRNA copies, extensive post-transcriptional modification adds a further layer to tRNA diversification. Whilst the crucial role of tRNAs as adapter molecules in protein translation is well established, whether all tRNAs are actually expressed, and whether the differences across isodecoders play any regulatory role is only recently being uncovered. Here we built upon recent developments in the use of NGS-based methods for RNA modification detection and developed tRAM-seq, an experimental protocol and in silico analysis pipeline to investigate tRNA expression and modification. Using tRAM-seq, we analysed the full ensemble of nucleo-cytoplasmic and mitochondrial tRNAs during embryonic development of the model vertebrate zebrafish. We show that the repertoire of tRNAs changes during development, with an apparent major switch in tRNA isodecoder expression and modification profile taking place around the start of gastrulation. Taken together, our findings suggest the existence of a general reprogramming of the expressed tRNA pool, possibly gearing the translational machinery for distinct stages of the delicate and crucial process of embryo development."
