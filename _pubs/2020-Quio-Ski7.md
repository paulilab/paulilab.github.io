abstract: "Post-transcriptional gene regulation is crucial during the oocyte-to-embryo transition, which is characterized by dramatic developmental changes in the absence of nuclear transcription. Under these conditions, changes to RNA content depend solely on RNA degradation. Although mechanisms that promote RNA decay during embryogenesis are known, it remains unclear which machineries contribute to remodeling the maternal transcriptome during the oocyte-to-embryo transition. Here, we focused on the auxiliary 3'-to-5' degradation factor Ski7 in zebrafish as its mRNA peaks during this transition. Homozygous ski7 mutant fish developed into morphologically normal adults, yet they had decreased fertility. Transcriptome profiling identified stage-specific mRNA targets of Ski7. Genes upregulated in ski7 mutants were generally lowly expressed in wild type, suggesting that Ski7 maintains low transcript levels for this subset of genes. GO analyses of mis-regulated genes implicated Ski7 in redox regulation. This was confirmed experimentally by an increased resistance of ski7 mutant embryos to reductive stress. Overall, our results provide insights into the physiological role of vertebrate Ski7 as an important post-transcriptional regulator during the oocyte-to-embryo transition."
