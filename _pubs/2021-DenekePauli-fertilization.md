abstract: "Fertilization is a multistep process that culminates in the fusion of sperm and egg, thus marking the beginning of a new organism in sexually reproducing species. Despite its importance for reproduction, the molecular mechanisms that regulate this singular event, particularly sperm–egg fusion, have remained mysterious for many decades. Here, we summarize our current molecular understanding of sperm–egg interaction, focusing mainly on mammalian fertilization. Given the fundamental importance of sperm–egg fusion yet the lack of knowledge of this process in vertebrates, we discuss hallmarks and emerging themes of cell fusion by drawing from well-studied examples such as viral entry, placenta formation, and muscle development. We conclude by identifying open questions and exciting avenues for future studies in gamete fusion."
