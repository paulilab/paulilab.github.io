abstract: "A large number of mRNAs of maternal origin are produced during oogenesis and deposited in the oocyte. Since transcription stops at the onset of meiosis during oogenesis and does not resume until later in embryogenesis, maternal mRNAs are the only templates for protein synthesis during this period. To ensure that a protein is made in the right place at the right time, the translation of maternal mRNAs must be activated at a specific stage of development. Here we summarize our current understanding of the sophisticated mechanisms that contribute to the temporal repression of maternal mRNAs, termed maternal mRNA dormancy. We discuss mechanisms at the level of the RNA itself, such as the regulation of polyadenine tail length and RNA modifications, as well as at the level of RNA-binding proteins, which often block the assembly of translation initiation complexes at the 5' end of an mRNA or recruit mRNAs to specific subcellular compartments. We also review microRNAs and other mechanisms that contribute to repressing translation, such as ribosome dormancy. Importantly, the mechanisms responsible for mRNA dormancy during the oocyte-to-embryo transition are also relevant to cellular quiescence in other biological contexts."
