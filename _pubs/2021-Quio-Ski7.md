abstract: "Post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression is crucial during the oocyte-to-embryo transition, a highly dynamic process characterized by the absence of nuclear transcription. Thus, changes to the RNA content are solely dependent on RNA degradation. Although several mechanisms that promote RNA decay during embryogenesis have been identified, it remains unclear which machineries contribute to remodeling the maternal transcriptome. Here, we focused on the degradation factor Ski7 in zebrafish. Homozygous ski7 mutant fish had higher proportions of both poor quality eggs and eggs that were unable to develop beyond the one-cell stage. Consistent with the idea that Ski7 participates in remodeling the maternal RNA content, transcriptome profiling identified hundreds of misregulated mRNAs in the absence of Ski7. Furthermore, upregulated genes were generally lowly expressed in wild type, suggesting that Ski7 maintains low transcript levels for this subset of genes. Finally, GO enrichment and proteomic analyses of misregulated factors implicated Ski7 in the regulation of redox processes. This was confirmed experimentally by an increased resistance of ski7 mutant embryos to reductive stress. Our results provide first insights into the physiological role of vertebrate Ski7 as a post-transcriptional regulator during the oocyte-to-embryo transition."
