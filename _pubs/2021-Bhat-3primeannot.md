abstract: "Alternative cleavage and polyadenylation generates mRNA 30 isoforms in a cell type-specific manner. Due to finite available RNA sequencing data of organisms with vast cell type complexity, currently available gene annotation resources are incomplete, which poses significant challenges to the comprehensive interpretation and quantification of transcriptomes. In this chapter, we introduce 30GAmES, a stand-alone computational pipe- line for the identification and quantification of novel mRNA 30end isoforms from 30mRNA sequencing data. 30GAmES expands available repositories and improves comprehensive gene-tag counting by cost-effective 30 mRNA sequencing, faithfully mirroring whole- transcriptome RNAseq measurements. By employing R and bash shell scripts (assem- bled in a Singularity container) 30GAmES systematically augments cell type-specific 30 ends of RNA polymerase II transcripts and increases the sensitivity of quantitative gene expression profiling by 30 mRNA sequencing.
