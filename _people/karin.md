Karin studied Molecular Biotechnology for her master’s degree at the University of Applied Sciences in Vienna (2006-2011). During that time, Karin performed her master’s thesis work in Cambridge working with neurogenetics in Drosophila. She continued working with fruit flies in the Straw lab at the IMP, dissecting and staining thousands of fly brains. Joining the Pauli lab in 2015, she now takes care of thousands of zebrafish. She also works on characterizing selected small peptides involved in zebrafish development. Karin has a deep love for jellyfish and enjoys going to the theater, reading crime novels, and avoiding vegetables at all costs.
