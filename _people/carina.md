Carina obtained a BSc in Biology (2011) and a MSc in Genetics and Developmental Biology (2014) from the University of Vienna. For her Masterâ€™s thesis, she studied gene regulatory elements in the sea anemone *Nematostella vectensis* [Technau lab](https://neurodevbio.univie.ac.at/technau-research/). Afterwards she continued working with *Nematostella* in Vienna and Bergen. In 2016, Carina joined the Vienna Biocenter as a research assistant (Bell lab, IMBA), focusing on Polycomb biology in mouse embryonic stem cells. In the Pauli lab, Carina works on translational regulation in zebrafish. In her free time, she enjoys playing billiards and singing in a choir.
