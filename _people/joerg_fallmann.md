After his Masters in Molecular Biology at the [University of Vienna](https://www.univie.ac.at/) in 2011, Jörg switched from wet-lab to dry-lab and joined the [Bioinformatics and Computational Biology](https://bcb.cs.univie.ac.at/)/[Theoretical Biochemistry](https://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/) research group of [Ivo L. Hofacker](https://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~ivo/) for his PhD. Investigating RNA-protein interactions, RNA regulation and regulatory networks, he developed a keen interest in computational analysis of high-throughput data. In 2016 he joined the [Bioinformatics Group](https://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/) of [Peter F. Stadler](http://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/~studla/) at the Department of Computer Science and the Interdisciplinary Center for Bioinformatics [(IZBI)](https://www.izbi.uni-leipzig.de/) of the [University of Leipzig](https://www.uni-leipzig.de/) as a PostDoctoral researcher associated with the German network for bioinformatics infrastructure [(de.NBI)](https://www.denbi.de/). He continued his work in RNA bioinformatics with a focus on non-coding RNAs and the processes and mechanisms behind the regulation of gene expression, especially on the level of RNA, RNA secondary structure and the plethora of interactions shaping this level. As member of the Pauli & Obenauf labs, Jörg will continue as embedded Bioinformatician to develop pipelines and tools for Omics data analysis and integration in a very exciting setting. In his spare time Jörg likes to lift some weights, travel with his familiy and engage with nature and visit a Heurigen or two.
