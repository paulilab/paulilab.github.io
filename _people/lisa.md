In 2016 Lisa received her B.Sc. for studying Medical and Pharmaceutical Biotechnology at the University of Applied Sciences, Krems, Austria. For her thesis, she joined the lab of Prof. Fiona Watt at the King’s College London, where she investigated extrinsic and intrinsic signaling in the human interfollicular epidermal stem cell niche. During her Master studies, she aimed to uncover potential therapeutic peptides targeting colon cancer by means of phage displays at the R&D department of her home university. In September 2017, she went back to her greatest interests – stem cell and developmental biology - when joining the Pauli Lab. Consequently, in February 2018 she started in the Pauli Lab as a master student focusing on the role of Toddler in regulating gastrulation movements. Outside the lab, Lisa enjoys outdoor sports reaching from hiking and climbing to mountain-biking and ski-touring.
