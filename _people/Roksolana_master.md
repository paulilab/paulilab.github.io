Roksolana received a BSc in Molecular Biology from the University of Vienna in 2022. During her undergraduate studies she spent two years in the Gregor Mendel Institute of Molecular Plant Biology in the lab of Yasin Dagdas, optimizing proximity labeling-based interactomics approaches to discover novel autophagy players that play a role in plants during virus infection. For her Masterâ€™s project she joined the Pauli lab. In her free time, she likes reading, going on long walks, traveling, and spending time with friends.
