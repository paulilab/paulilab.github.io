Laura studied biology in Valencia, Spain (2007-2012). She then obtained a master’s degree in Plant Biology and Biotechnology from the Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona. For her PhD (20015-2019), Laura joined [Michael Hothorn’s laboratory](http://web.structplantbio.org/) at the University of Geneva, Switzerland, to investigate the metabolism of inorganic polyphosphates in plants. During her PhD, Laura discovered a bicistronic transcript controlling the expression of a cell cycle regulator. In parallel, she uncovered a novel polyphosphate-binding domain using structural biology and quantitative biochemistry. Her findings sparked her interest in translational regulation, a topic which she will focus on during her postdoctoral studies in the Pauli lab.
