Andreas graduated from the [University of Hamburg](https://www.chemie.uni-hamburg.de/studium/bachelor/mls-bsc/studieninteressierte.html) in Molecular Life Sciences (B.Sc.) in 2016. Here, he first approached developmental biology in the labs of [Peter Bommert](https://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/en/forschung/molekular-und-zellbiologie/entwbio/ag-forschung/f-bommert.html) and Arp Schnittger. Andreas then moved to Tübingen, Germany, where he completed his Biochemistry studies (M.Sc.) at the [Eberhard Karls University](https://uni-tuebingen.de/de/30323) in January 2019. For his thesis, he studied kinase activity during meiotic recombination in yeast in [John Weir’s lab](http://www.weirlab.com/) at the [Friedrich Miescher Laboratory](http://www.fml.tuebingen.mpg.de/) of the Max Planck Society. In the Pauli lab, Andreas is interested in studying the process of fertilization. Andreas was awarded a [Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds PhD fellowship](https://www.bifonds.de/fellowships-grants/phd-fellowships.html) for his PhD studies in 2020. In his spare time, Andreas likes to travel; the best locations are those where he can use his skis as well.
