She joined the lab of [Markus Landthaler](https://www.mdc-berlin.de/de/landthaler) at the [MDC-BIMSB](https://www.mdc-berlin.de/de/bimsb) in early 2024 and performed her bachelors thesis on SRP mediated mRNA localization to the ER here. In the fall of 2024, Lucie began her Masters in Biochemistry at the [Freie Universitaet Berlin](https://www.fu-berlin.de/) while continuing to work in Markus Landthaler's Lab until end of 2024 on projects related to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and nuclear export of unspliced transcripts. 
She joined the Pauli Lab for an internship in April 2025. She is working with Amy on the impact of maternal age on the developemental competence of embryos. In her free time, she enjoys singing, cooking and painting.
