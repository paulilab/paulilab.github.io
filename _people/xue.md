Xué was born in Colombia, but grew up in Tyrol, Austria. In 2012, she moved to Vienna to start her bachelor studies in biology. For her bachelor's thesis, she worked on RNA editing in the Jantsch lab at the MFPL in Vienna. In summer 2017, Xué moved on to an internship in cancer research to study skeletal muscle turnover at the Bergmann lab at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden. Currently, she is a joint master student in the Pauli and Cochella labs. Her project focuses on small RNAs in early zebrafish development.
