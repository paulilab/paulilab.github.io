Quio studied [Genomic Sciences](http://www.lcg.unam.mx/es/about) at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (2010-2014). During his bachelor's thesis, he worked on plant embryo development in the laboratory of [Stewart Gillmor at LANGEBIO](http://langebio.cinvestav.mx/?pag=854). In 2014, Quio moved to Norwich, UK, to study plant-pathogen interactions at The Earlham Institute (formerly The Genome Analysis Centre) and The Sainsbury Laboratory. There, he used next generation sequencing techniques to understand the evolution of wheat pathogens under the supervision of Diane Saunders and [Sophien Kamoun](http://www.tsl.ac.uk/groups/kamoun-group/). Quio joined the Pauli lab in December 2015, where he is studying the regulation of translation during early embryogenesis. Quio was awarded a [Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds PhD fellowship](https://www.bifonds.de/fellowships-grants/phd-fellowships.html) in 2016. Quio's hobbies include cooking new foods, watching musicals, and reading science fiction novels.
