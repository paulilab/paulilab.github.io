Quio studied Genomic Sciences at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (2010-2014). During his Bachelor's thesis, he worked on plant embryo development in the laboratory of Stewar Gillmor at LANGEBIO. Quio moved to Norwich, UK, to study plant-pathogen interactions at The Earlham Institute (previously known as The Genome Analysis Centre) and The Sainsbury Laboratory, using Next Generation Sequencing techniques. Quio joined the Pauli lab on Dec 2015 where he is studying the regulation of translation during early embryogenesis.
