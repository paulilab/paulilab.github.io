Sarah studied biochemistry and molecular biology at the University of Bayreuth in Germany (2009-2015). During her master’s, she completed a 6-month-long internship in the lab of Sir John Gordon in Cambridge, where she studied the expression of retrotransposons during *Xenopus laevis* embryogenesis. For her master’s thesis, she worked on cell cycle regulation during mitosis in the lab of Olaf Stemmann. In November 2015, she became the first Ph.D. student in the Pauli lab. Her project aims to unravel the molecular processes underlying fertilization. In May 2016, Sarah was awarded the DOC Fellowship from the Austrian Academy of Sciences (ÖAW) for her Ph.D. work. Outside of the lab, Sarah enjoys reading and learning Spanish with our lab-manager Karin.
