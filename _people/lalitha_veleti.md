Lalitha is from India and finished undergrad education there in April 2019 before moving to the Netherlands in 2020 for her master's. During her master's, she worked on projects in the areas of mRNA transcription, splicing and decay regulation. Captivated by gene expression regulation, Lalitha joined the Pauli lab in November 2022 to work on understanding translation regulation in early embryonic development in Zebrafish. Beside the scientific aspect of biology, she also cares deeply about science education and communication. Outside science, Lalitha enjoys cooking, reading, running, and painting.
