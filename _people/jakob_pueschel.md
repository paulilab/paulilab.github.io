Jakob obtained a BSc in Molecular Biotechnology from Technical University Dresden in 2019. Subsequently, he worked on identifying promising biomarkers for successful radiotherapy in the group of Anna Dubrovska. Due to his interest in regeneration and developmental biology, he enrolled in the master’s program of Regeneration and Technology at Utrecht University. During this program, he worked on the detection of viral replication dynamics in the group of Marvin Tanenbaum at the Hubrecht Institute and joined the Pauli lab for his final master’s project. He enjoys running, playing chess, and learning languages.
