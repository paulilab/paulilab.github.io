Andi studied biochemistry (1998-2002) in [Regensburg](https://www.uni-regensburg.de/en), Germany, and molecular and cellular biology (2002-2004) at the [Ruprecht-Karls University of Heidelberg](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/index_e.html) in Germany. For her PhD, Andi joined the labs of Kim Nasmyth and Barry Dickson as a joint Ph.D. student at the [IMP in Vienna, Austria](https://www.imp.ac.at) to uncover post-mitotic functions for cohesin in *Drosophila*. In 2006, Andi moved with [Kim’s lab](https://www.bioch.ox.ac.uk/research/nasmyth) to [Oxford, UK](http://www.ox.ac.uk) where she obtained her D.Phil. (2009) and became an avid rower. For her post-doctoral studies (2009-2015), Andi traded flies for fish and joined [Alex Schier’s lab](https://schierlab.biozentrum.unibas.ch/) at [Harvard University, USA](https://www.mcb.harvard.edu). Since 2015, Andi has had her own lab at the [IMP](https://www.imp.ac.at), first as a junior group leader and since 2022 as a senior group leader. Andi's lab has been funded by the [ERC](https://erc.europa.eu/homepage), the [FWF START Prize](https://www.fwf.ac.at/en/research-funding/fwf-programmes/start-programme/) and a FWF-funded SFB [RNADeco](https://www.rna-deco.org/), the [HFSP organization](https://www.hfsp.org/funding/hfsp-funding/research-grants), the [EMBO Young Investigator Programme (EMBO YIP)](http://embo.org/funding-awards/young-investigators), and a Whitman Center Fellowship from the [Marine Biological Labs](http://www.mbl.edu) in addition to core funding from the [IMP](http://www.imp.ac.at/) and [Boehringer Ingelheim](https://www.boehringer-ingelheim.com/).
