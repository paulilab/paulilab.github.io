Andi studied biochemistry (1998-2002) in Regensburg, Germany, and molecular and cellular biology (2002-2004) at the [Ruprecht-Karls University of Heidelberg](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/index_e.html) in Germany. During this time, her love for basic research was born. Andi joined the labs of Kim Nasmyth and Barry Dickson as a joint Ph.D. student at the [IMP in Vienna, Austria](https://www.imp.ac.at) to uncover post-mitotic functions for cohesin in *Drosophila*. In 2006, Andi moved with [Kim’s lab](https://www.bioch.ox.ac.uk/research/nasmyth) to [Oxford, UK](http://www.ox.ac.uk) where she obtained her D.Phil. (2009) and became an avid rower (Oxford Blues 2007-2008). For her post-doctoral studies (2009-2015), Andi traded flies for fish and joined [Alex Schier’s lab](http://www.schierlab.fas.harvard.edu) at [Harvard University, USA](https://www.mcb.harvard.edu). During this time, she made two key discoveries that have since shaped her research: (1) translation is widespread outside of annotated protein-coding regions, and (2) newly identified short proteins can have fundamental functions. Andi's work has been funded by several fellowships and awards: [EMBO](http://www.embo.org/funding-awards/fellowships/long-term-fellowships) (2009-2010) and [HFSP](http://www.hfsp.org/funding/postdoctoral-fellowships) (2010-2013) long-term postdoctoral fellowships, the [NIH grant to independence](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/ep/pathway.html) (K99) (2013-2015), the [Chi-Bin Chien Award](https://mcbpublic.unix.fas.harvard.edu/mcb/news/news-detail/3737/genetics-society-of-america-honored-andrea-pauli-schier-lab/) from the [Genetics Society of America](http://www.genetics-gsa.org) (2014), the HFSP Career Development Award (2015-2019), the [FWF START Prize](https://www.fwf.ac.at/en/research-funding/fwf-programmes/start-programme/) (2018-2024), and a Whitman Center Fellowship from the [Marine Biological Labs](http://www.mbl.edu) (2018). Since 2015, Andi has had her own lab at the [IMP](https://www.imp.ac.at).
