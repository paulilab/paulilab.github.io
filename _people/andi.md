Andi studied biochemistry (1998-2002) in Regensburg, Germany, and molecular and cellular biology (2002-2004) at the Ruprecht-Karls University of Heidelberg in Germany. During this time, her love for basic research was born. Andi joined the labs of Kim Nasmyth and Barry Dickson as a joint Ph.D. student at the IMP in Vienna, Austria, to uncover post-mitotic functions for cohesin in *Drosophila*. In 2006, Andi moved with Kim’s lab to Oxford, UK, where she obtained her D.Phil. (2009) and became an avid rower (Oxford Blues 2007-2008). For her post-doctoral studies (2009-2015), Andi traded flies for fish and joined Alex Schier’s lab at Harvard University, USA. During this time, she made the two following key discoveries that have since shaped her research: (1) translation is widespread outside of annotated protein-coding regions, and (2) newly identified short proteins can have fundamental functions (e.g. the previously overlooked protein, Toddler/Apela/ELABELA). Since 2015, Andi has had her own lab at the IMP.
