Sebastian studied Biotechnology at the [TH Bingen](https://www.th-bingen.de/), Germany, where he completed his Bachelor’s degree in 2024. For his Bachelor thesis, he joined the lab of [René Ketting](https://www.imb.de/research/ketting/research) at [the Institute of Molecular Biology (IMB)](https://www.imb.de/) in Mainz, Germany, where he investigated small RNA biogenesis. Alongside the start of his Master’s studies in Synthetic Biotechnology at TH Bingen, Sebastian continued working in the Ketting lab as a research assistant. In August 2025, he joined the Pauli lab for his Master’s thesis, where he is working with Johannes on characterising the  fertilisation complex, using _C. elegans_ as a model system. In his free time, he  enjoys playing basketball, running, and cooking.
