Marcus studied genetics at the University of Vienna, where he first approached developmental biology in the Genikhovich Group, working on the role of Wnt- and BMP-signaling in axis formation in the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis. Building the bridge between his interests, he studied developmental biology and genetics with a focus on cancer and disease at the University of Vienna. He completed his Master studies in the Distel group at the Children’s Cancer Research Institute of Vienna (CCRI), where he established a NUP-98 fusion mediated acute myeloid leukemia model in zebrafish. After obtaining his master’s degree in 2020, Marcus helped to develop a platform for NGS-based Covid-19 mutation monitoring in Austria, assuring the nationwide Covid-19 variant surveillance. In the Pauli lab, Marcus is working with Laura on translational regulation.
