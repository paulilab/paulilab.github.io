Isa holds a Bachelor of Science in Biology from the [University of Cologne](https://www.uni-koeln.de/en/), where she completed her thesis in [Matthias Hammerschmidt](https://ag-hammerschmidt.zoologie.uni-koeln.de/)'s lab in 2022, studying epidermal tumors in zebrafish psoriasis mutants. She is currently pursuing a Master’s in Molecular Biology at the [University of Vienna](https://www.univie.ac.at/en/), with a focus on stem cell and developmental biology. In summer 2024, Isa worked with Laura on mRNA dormancy. For her master's project, she now joined Anastasia in the mitochondria team to investigate mitochondrial morphology during zebrafish development. In her free time, Isa enjoys hiking, skiing, and spinning.
