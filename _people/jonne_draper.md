Jonne received a BSc in Biology in 2020. During the corona pandemic, she worked on phase I trials in the oncology department of a university hospital. In 2021, she enrolled in the masterâ€™s program of Cancer, Stem Cells and Developmental Biology at Utrecht University. She has worked on identifying a new apoptotic pathway after DNA damage using haploid genetic screens in the group of Thijn Brummelkamp at the Netherlands Cancer Institute. For her final project, she joined the fertilization team in the Pauli lab. Besides feeding her curiosity on a broad spectrum of biological subjects by reading, watching documentaries and visiting museums, she enjoys dancing, hiking, cooking, spending time with friends and being creative!
