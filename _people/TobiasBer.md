Tobiáš began his biological journey at the age of 11 by setting up breeding experiments with Hermann’s tortoises. This endeavor came to an unfortunate end, but he has remained fascinated by animals ever since. He completed his undergraduate studies at [Charles University](https://natur.cuni.cz/en) in Prague (2020–2025). During this time, he worked with [Petr Svoboda](https://www.img.cas.cz/group/petr-svoboda/) at the [Institute of Molecular Genetics](https://www.img.cas.cz/en/). In Petr’s lab, he worked on establishing a new model organism - slugs of the genus Deroceras - to study their unique reproductive strategies. In the Pauli lab, Tobiáš will dive into the obscure but remarkable world of killifish biology under the mentorship of Ida. In his free time, Tobiáš simply enjoys being outside, moving freely either on his bike or on foot.
