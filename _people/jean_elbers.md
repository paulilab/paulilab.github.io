Jean started his career in ecology (BS & MSc thesis projects) but worked on the [conservation genetics of gopher tortoises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_tortoise) for his PhD at [Louisiana State University](https://lsu.edu). During his PhD, he developed computational skills in bioinformatics and further improved on those skills in his postdoctoral work at Louisiana State University and the [University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna](https://www.vetmeduni.ac.at/en/)/[University of Vienna](https://www.univie.ac.at/en/). Prior to joining the Pauli and [Obenauf](https://www.obenauflab.com) labs as a joint bioinformatician at the IMP, he worked at the [Institute of Science and Technology Austria](https://ist.ac.at/de/home/) as a bioinformatician. Jean considers himself a 'tool-manipulating primate'. He is not restricted to any particular programming language and sometimes uses many tools and languages (C, Perl, Python, R, Zig, Rust, Bash) combined together to get the job done.
