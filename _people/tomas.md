In 2008, Tomas got his M.Sc. degree in computer graphics from the
[Charles University Prague (MFF)](https://www.mff.cuni.cz/to.en/) (2001-2008). 
He left academia and worked for few years on various machine learning and computer vision topics in industry. 
In 2016, he got his Ph.D. from the University of Vienna for his computational work on
enhancer biology in the [Alex Stark Group @ IMP](http://starklab.org/) and
[Christoph Lampert Group @ IST Austria](http://pub.ist.ac.at/~chl/).
In the Pauli Lab, he develops image analysis methods for developmental
biologists, mainly focusing on cell tracking in terabyte-sized
data sets.
He also works on imaging and image analysis methods for neuroscientists in
the [Zimmer Lab](https://www.imp.ac.at/groups/manuel-zimmer/).
