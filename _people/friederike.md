Friederike joined our lab recently as a technician in a Boehringer Ingelheim collaboration. She obtained her master's degree in neuroscience from the Ruprecht-Karls-University in Heidelberg, Germany (2006-2012). Her thesis focused on nuclear calcium signaling in neurons and its influence on gene expression. Then she moved from cell culture work to organismal research and joined the lab of Alipasha Vaziri at the IMP in Vienna as a PhD student, where she was working on the neuronal dynamics in the zebrafish larval brain (2013-2018). Friederike is an active member of the Vienna skeptics community and a co-organizer of the Austrian science festival "WissensDurst".
