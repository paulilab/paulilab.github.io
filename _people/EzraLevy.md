Ezra earned his undergraduate degree in Biochemistry from Northeastern University in 2019. While at Northeastern, he worked in the lab of [Nikolai Slavov](https://slavovlab.net/) on method development for mass spectrometry-based single-cell proteomics. This experience sparked his love of research, and inspired him to pursue a PhD. He joined the research groups of [Eszter Posfai](https://www.posfailab.org/) and [Stas Shvartsman](http://shvartsmanlab.com/) in the [Department of Molecular Biology](https://molbio.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University. There he developed techniques for live imaging germ cell dynamics in the embryonic mouse ovary, earning his PhD in 2025. He joined the Pauli lab in 2025, where he will pursue his interest in germline biology at the molecular level. Outside of the lab Ezra can be found biking, hiking, and making music with friends.
