Amy graduated from [Queen’s University in Canada](https://www.queensu.ca/) with a B.Sc. in Biology in 2013. She then made her first foray into the world of developmental biology in the lab of [Julie Claycomb](https://www.claycomblab.com/) at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/), where she pursued a Master’s in Molecular Genetics. There, she focused on the intersection between co-transcriptional RNA processing and small RNA pathways in C. elegans germline development. Her PhD came with a big move across the Atlantic, as she relocated to [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/de.html), where she examined different mechanisms of transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulation in mammalian systems in the labs of [Stefanie Jonas](https://jonaslab.ethz.ch/) and Constance Ciaudo. Amy will continue to pursue her RNA-centric interests during her postdoc and will look into how maternal age affects the molecular environment in the early embryo leading to reduced egg competence with a particular focus on post-transcriptional gene regulation. Outside of the lab, Amy spends her time on cooking, sports (running, padel and tennis), improv theater and consuming all kinds of comedy.
