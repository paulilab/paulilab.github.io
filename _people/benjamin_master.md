Benni obtained his BSc in Molecular Biotechnology (University of Applied Sciences FH Campus Vienna) in 2017. During his Master studies at the University of Vienna, he joined the Pauli lab at the IMP as research intern to identify the membrane proteome of zebrafish oocytes. As working with zebrafish is just the best, he eventually decided to continue working in the Pauli lab for his master thesis. His project focuses on zebrafish proteomics in regard to fertilization. In his free time, Benni enjoys climbing, sleeping or lying around on comfortable sofas while reading or watching TV.
