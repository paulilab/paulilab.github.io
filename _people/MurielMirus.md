Muriel completed her bachelor’s in biology at the [Ludwig-Maximilians University (LMU)](https://www.bio.lmu.de/en/) in Munich in 2022. For her thesis, she worked in the field of ecology where the investigated color variation in dragonflies. She then pursued an MSc in Molecular Biology at the [University of Vienna](https://www.univie.ac.at/en/), focusing on stem cell and developmental biology. For her master’s project in the lab of [Florian Raible](https://neurodevbio.univie.ac.at/raible-research/), she investigated how microvilli drive bristle formation in the marine polychaete Platynereis. For this work, she was awarded the [Rupert Riedl Scholarship](https://www.wifo-hdm.at/förderpreise).
In September 2025, Muriel joined the Pauli lab at the (IMP) to pursue her PhD. She now investigates the cellular and molecular mechanisms of fertilization and fusion in zebrafish—marking her shift toward vertebrate model systems. Outside the lab, Muriel balances work at the bench with Muay Thai and rides on the road bike. When it’s time to slow down, yoga and books are her go-to recovery strategies.
