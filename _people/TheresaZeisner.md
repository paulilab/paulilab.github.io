Theresa studied Natural Sciences (Biochemistry) at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) (2015–2019). For her Master’s thesis, she joined Philip Zegerman’s lab at the [Gurdon Institute](https://www.gurdon.cam.ac.uk/), studying the role of the DNA damage checkpoint in preventing DNA topological stress. She then pursued a PhD in [Paul Nurse’s lab](https://www.crick.ac.uk/research/labs/paul-nurse) at the [Francis Crick Institute](https://www.crick.ac.uk/) in London, investigating the role of CDK-opposing phosphatases in cell cycle regulation. During her PhD, she was awarded a [Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds PhD fellowship](https://www.bifonds.de/fellowships-grants/phd-fellowships.html) and received the BSCB Young Cell Biologist of the Year prize. In September 2025, she joined the Pauli lab to explore the molecular mechanisms regulating proteostasis during early embryogenesis. Outside the lab, Theresa enjoys arts and crafts, from sewing to lino prints, exploring museums and reading in Vienna’s parks.
