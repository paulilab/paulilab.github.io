Josef received a BSc in Biology in 2019 and an MSc in 2022 from the [University of Vienna](https://www.univie.ac.at/en/). During his studies, Josef joined the lab of [Luisa Cochella](https://mbg.jhmi.edu/people/luisa-cochella-ph-d/) at the [IMP](https://www.imp.ac.at/) to study neuronal development in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. For his masterâ€™s thesis, he switched topics and worked on therapy resistance in breast cancer in the lab of [Jos Jonkers](https://www.nki.nl/research/research-groups/jos-jonkers/) at the [Netherlands Cancer Institute in Amsterdam](https://www.nki.nl/). By joining the Pauli lab in February 2022, Josef returned to the IMP and the field of developmental biology and is interested in translational inhibition in the early zebrafish embryo and different somatic cell types. In his free time, he likes to do sports, cooking, baking and listening to music.
