Krista is from the United States, where she attended North Park University and earned her Bachelor of Science degree (2010-2014) with a double major in Biology and Chemistry. She later completed her Master of Science degree (2015-2017) in Experimental and Medical Biosciences at Linköping University in Sweden. After giving cancer research a try early in her master’s, she attended the VBC Summer School in 2016 and as a summer intern in the Pauli lab, returned to her favorite area of biology—development. Krista continued in the Pauli lab and completed her master’s thesis on the characterization of vertebrate fertilization factors in fish, and subsequently joined the lab as a Ph.D. student starting September 2017. Her Ph.D. work focuses on the molecular players and species-specificity of vertebrate fertilization. Krista’s other interests include marine biology and conservation, and she enjoys baking, figure skating, learning foreign languages, and riding her bike around Vienna.
