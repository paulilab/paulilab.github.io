Alisa studied Biology at the University of DÃ¼sseldorf to obtain her B.Sc. degree. During her thesis, she investigated the biosynthetic transport of cell-cell contact proteins in Drosophila melanogaster. Since 2020 she is studying at the University of Vienna with a focus on Genetics and Developmental Biology (M.Sc.). After a two-month internship she joined the Pauli Group as a Master student. Together with Frieda she studies dormant egg ribosomes in zebrafish embryos. In her free time Alisa does different sports like tennis, table tennis and dancing. In addition to biology, she is also interested in space travel and exploration.
