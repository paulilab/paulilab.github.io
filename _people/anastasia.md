Anastasia studied biochemistry and molecular biology at Lomonosov Moscow State University (2009-2014). Her diploma project focused on understanding structural features of Hansenula polymorpha TERT (Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase). Already during her diploma studies Anastasia became interested in the function of newly predicted peptides in eukaryotic cells â€“ a topic she decided to pursue for her PhD where she investigated the function of a mitochondrial peptide encoded by a misannotated lncRNA. Anastasia joined the Pauli lab in March 2019 to investigate mitochondrial functionality and co-regulation of mitochondrial and cytoplasmic translation during development. In her free time, Anastasia enjoys reading detective stories, knitting and snowboarding.
