Ida studied molecular biomedicine at the University of Copenhagen and McGill University in Montréal where she graduated in 2015. For her master’s and PhD studies, she was accepted to the [International Max Planck Research School in Molecular for Biology](https://uni-goettingen.de/en/663763.html) in Göttingen, Germany. There, she joined the lab of [Melina Schuh](https://www.mpinat.mpg.de/mschuh) at the Max Planck Institute for Multidisciplinary Science to study how mammalian eggs store proteins for the first stages of embryogenesis. Ida was awarded a [Boehringer Ingelheim PhD fellowship](https://www.bifonds.de/fellowships-grants/phd-fellowships.html) and the prestigious [International Birnstiel Award for Doctoral Research in Molecular Life Sciences](https://www.imp.ac.at/achievements/birnstiel-award) as well as the [Otto Hahn Medal and Award](https://www.imp.ac.at/news/article/otto-hahn-medal-and-award-for-ida-jentoft) of the Max Planck Society for her PhD work. Ida joined the Pauli lab in February 2024 and is studying the fascinating phenomenon of embryonic diapause in Killifish. For her postdoctoral work, Ida was awarded [EMBO](https://www.imp.ac.at/news/article/hat-trick-for-pauli-lab-three-fellowships-for-postdocs-and-student) and [HFSP](https://www.hfsp.org/funding/hfsp-funding/postdoctoral-fellowships) postdoctoral fellowships. In her free time, Ida explores the outdoors in- or outside of Vienna wearing running, climbing, or hiking shoes.
