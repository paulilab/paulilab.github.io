Laurine obtained her BSc in Life Sciences in 2021 from the University of Montpellier (France), where she also pursued a Master's in Epigenetics, Genetics, and Cell Biology. During her first year of her Master's, Laurine joined the lab of Maud Borensztein at the Institut de Génétique Moléculaire de Montpellier, where she worked on understanding the molecular mechanisms upon X-Chromosome reactivation during the specification of the germline. For her final semester, she joined the Pauli lab and is working in the fertilization team. In her free time, Laurine likes to travel, read, dance, and enjoy coffee with friends.
