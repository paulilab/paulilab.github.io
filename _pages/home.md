## Research focus


We are interested in the control of embryogenesis. Our focus is on investigating new regulators, which range from short proteins to post-transcriptional control mechanisms.  


1)	**Fertilization**: How is fertilization regulated? We are specifically interested in identifying new molecular players that allow sperm-egg interaction and fusion.  


2)	**Toddler**: How does the short secreted protein Toddler (also called Apela/ELABELA) regulate gastrulation movements?  


3)	**Translational regulation**: We are interested in investigating translational regulation and regulation by translation during embryogenesis.  


### Our approach  

To address these questions, we are mainly using zebrafish embryos since they are a powerful model of vertebrate embryogenesis. We combine various experimentalÂ and computational approaches, ranging from genetics, molecular biology, cell biology and biochemistry to live cell imaging and genomics technologies.
