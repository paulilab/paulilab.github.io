## Functions of short translated open reading frames (ORFs) in the context of development

  description='Figure 1: Identification and annotation of novel, embryonically
    expressed coding and non-coding transcripts. RNA-Seq-based transcript
    assemblies were evaluated for their coding potential by PhyloCSF (Li et
    al., 2011; Pauli & Valen et al., 2012), BLAST and Ribosome Profiling (Chew
    et al., 2013; Pauli et al., 2014).  About ~400 novel coding genes in
    zebrafish, including Toddler, were identified (Pauli et al., 2014).'

Large-scale forward-genetic screens towards the end of the last century have
identified the majority of known embryonic signalling pathways and
embryonically essential genes. This relatively small set of genes with known
essential embryonic functions is in stark contrast to the large number of
transcripts that are expressed during embryogenesis (Pauli & Valen et al.,
2012). Moreover, hundreds of these transcripts were recently predicted to
encode small proteins (Chew et al., 2013; Pauli et al., 2014; Bazzini et al.,
2014). Apart from novel protein-coding genes, these studies have also
identified a large number of translated regions outside of protein-coding ORFs
on 5â€™ leaders of coding genes (upstream ORFs (uORFs)) and on transcripts
previously thought to be non-coding.

To determine if any of these uncharacterised, translated ORFs might have a
function, we focused on the putative signalling protein, Toddler (Pauli et al.,
2014). Toddler had previously been annotated as a non-coding RNA, but it
encodes a short, conserved, and secreted peptide. Zebrafish embryos lacking
Toddler peptide die during embryogenesis and lack a functional heart.

Local and ubiquitous expression of Toddler promotes mesendodermal cell movement
during gastrulation, suggesting that Toddler is neither an attractant nor a
repellent but acts globally as a motogen. Toddler drives internalization of
G-protein-coupled APJ/Apelin receptors, and activation of APJ/Apelin receptor
signalling rescues toddler mutants. These results indicate that Toddler is an
activator of APJ/Apelin receptor signalling, promotes gastrulation movements,
and might be the first in a series of uncharacterized developmental regulators.
Moreover, the discovery of Toddler provides the proof of principle that
functional, short translated ORFs remain to be identified.

We will build on these initial findings and investigate the functions and
mechanisms of short translated ORFs during embryogenesis. We will mainly use
zebrafish embryos since they are an ideal model system for functional genomics
in a developing organism.

    regions outside of known protein-coding genes are translated.

    in black.  Translated yet non-conserved ORFs are indicated in grey (e.g.
    upstream ORFs (uORFs)).'

We will focus on three main areas:

* What are the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which Toddler/Apelin
  receptor signalling promotes gastrulation movements?
* What are the functions of other conserved yet uncharacterized short proteins
  during embryogenesis?
* How does regulatory translation, e.g. of upstream ORFs (uORFs), contribute to
  developmental transitions?
