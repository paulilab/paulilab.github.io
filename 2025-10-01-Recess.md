The Pauli lab left the lab benches for three-days for this year’s **IMP–IMBA recess**! 

The event featured talks from all group leaders, providing a great overview of the breadth of research happening across the two institutes. While Andi presented the latest updates on our fertilisation work, Josef represented the dormancy side of the lab during the poster session. The event wrapped up with a great added dimension speaker - Jutta Kleinschmidt, who is the first woman to win the Dakar Rally – and a fun dinner together, featuring scientific cocktails!
