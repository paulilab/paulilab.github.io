Images
======

Please keep this folder tidy by following the rules:
* all photos are in JPEG format with a `.jpg` extension,
* place the folder in an appropriate subfolder (if the subfolder is missing and
  there will be more images like this one, create it),
* adhere to naming conventions you see (use of upper-/lower-case, underscores,
  &hellip;) to minimize possible errors.


Troubleshooting
---------------

If your picture does not show up, it is most probably because the filename is
not **exactly** what you specify.

Check:
* the filename character by character,
* check the extension `image.jpeg` is not the same as `image.jpg`.
* check case, all filename are case-sensitive, so `Image.jpg` is not the same
  as `image.jpg`.
