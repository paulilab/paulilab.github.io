Who would have thought that a PhD student from the Pauli lab would be awarded a 'Perutz Crystal Award' for her excellent research in structural biology? Big congratulations to **Frieda**, who suprised quite a few members of the VBC structural community about her structural studies during zebrafish development. 
This is a first for the Pauli lab, and only possible due to a fantastic collaboration with David Haselbach and his lab, as well as Laura in our own lab. Congratulations to Frieda and the whole team!
