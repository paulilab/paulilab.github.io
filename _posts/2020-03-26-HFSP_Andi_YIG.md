Delighted that my lab will join forces with Verena Ruprecht (coordinator) at the CRG in Barcelona, Spain, and Liu Yan-Jun at Fudan University, Shanghai, China, in a HFSP Young Investigator Grant to study biophysical aspects of fertilization. 
Our project is one of eight Young Investigator Grants chosen for funding in the latest call of the Human Frontier Science Program (HFSP). Having been awarded this grant means that I/my lab has benefited from continous funding from the HFSP since 2010 (postdoc fellowship, then Career Development Award, and now Young Investigator Grant), and we are extremely grateful for this continous support of our research. Thank you HFSP!
