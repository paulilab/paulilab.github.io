Over the past two months we had James Kiraly from the University of Texas at Austin, US, joining our lab as a VBC summer student. This year marked the 10th anniversary of the VBC summer school, which we celebrated with a big symposium where alumni and current student presented their research. It's amazing to see 1) what you can achieve within 2 months of summer school, and 2) what former VBC summer school students are currently doing (anything from being postdocs/PhD students at Stanford, Caltec, MIT, IMP, working at NASA etc). Keep up your passion for science and the great work!
