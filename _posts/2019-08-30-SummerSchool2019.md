Over the past two months we had **James Kiraly** from the University of Texas at Austin, US, joining our lab as a VBC summer student. This year marked the **10th anniversary of the VBC summer school**, which we celebrated with a symposium where alumni and current students presented their research. It was inspiring to see 1) what students can achieve within 2 months of summer school, and 2) what former VBC summer school students have been up in the meanwhile (anything from being postdocs/PhD students at Stanford, Caltec, MIT and the VBC to working at NASA etc.). Keep up your passion for science and the great work!
