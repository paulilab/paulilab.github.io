Good news after all! Though it took a while, our first RT-LAMP paper is finally not only on [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.23.166397v3) but is 'officially' out in [Frontiers in Molecular Biosciences](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmolb.2022.801309/full)!
This has been an amazing collaborative effort with Julius Brennecke and **Andi** joining forces during the pandemic to lead a team of students who spearheaded the development of a cheap, open-access and sensitive RT-LAMP-based SARS-CoV-2 assay for laboratory and home-based testing during the pandemic.
Congratulations to all authors, particularly the first authors Max Kellner, Julian Ross and Jakob Schnabl, all of our campus-wide (VCDI initiative) as well as national and international collaborators (Manuela Foedinger and team from Klinik Favoriten, Andrew Straw, Luis Aries-Menendez) and our campus directors that made it possible by supporting our efforts throughout the pandemic!
