Good news after all! 

Though it took a while, our first RT-LAMP paper is finally not only on [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.23.166397v3) but is 'officially' out in [Frontiers in Molecular Biosciences](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmolb.2022.801309/full)! This has been an amazing collaborative effort with **Julius Brennecke and Andi** joining forces during the pandemic to lead a team of students who spearheaded the development of a cheap, open-access and sensitive RT-LAMP-based SARS-CoV-2 assay for laboratory and home-based testing during the pandemic.

Congratulations to all authors, particularly first authors Max Kellner, Julian Ross and Jakob Schnabl, and all of our campus-wide (VCDI initiative) as well as national & international collaborators (Manuela Foedinger & team, Andrew Straw, Luis Aries-Menendez), and a big thank you to our institutes' directors for supporting our efforts throughout the pandemic!
