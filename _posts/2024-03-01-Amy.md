A very warm welcome to **Amy**, new postdoc in the Pauli lab! 

Amy (Amena Nabih) did her PhD in Stefanie Jonas's lab at the ETH in ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland, where she investigated the mechanism of gene-specific transcription regulation by the Integrator complex. In the Pauli lab, Amy will be studying the molecular basis of age-related changes in developmental competence in zebrafish. 
We are really excited to have you on board!
