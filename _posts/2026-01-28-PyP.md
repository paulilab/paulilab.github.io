Our two new PhD students **Muriel** and **Tobiáš** joined the 2025/2026 Vienna BioCenter PhD cohort for a 3-week [‘Prime Your PhD (PyP)’](https://training.vbc.ac.at/phd-program/training-program/) course, including lectures from VBC faculty, writing and presenting training as well as team building activities. Now being fully 'primed' and ready for anything their PhD will bring along, we are excited to have you back with us in the lab!

A warm welcome to all new PhD students on our campus!
