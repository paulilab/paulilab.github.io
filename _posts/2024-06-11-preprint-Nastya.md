New pre-print alert from the Pauli lab! 

In this study led by **Anastasia**, we asked how mitochondria get activated during embryogenesis. Surprisingly we found that activation does not depend on de novo mitochondrial biogenesis or an increase in abundance or enzymatic activity of electron transport chain complexes. Instead, by combining mitochondrial (phospho)proteomics, metabolomics and morphological analyses, Anastasia identified an increase in ER-mitochondrial interaction and fusion of mitochondria as hallmarks of mitochondrial activation during embryogenesis. If you are interested in reading more, here is a link to our [pre-print](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.06.11.598492v1).

Huge congratulations to Anastasia and all co-authors for contributing to this comprehensive resource of mitochondrial activation during embryogenesis!
