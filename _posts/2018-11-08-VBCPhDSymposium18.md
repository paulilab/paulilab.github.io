For this yearâ€™s VBC PhD Symposium, an entirely student-led event, students chose the theme, "Metamorphosis: Transforming Science." The event brought scientists from various disciplines together, ranging from technology and communication, to health and the environment. It was a big success! It also featured the very first (of hopefully many) installation of Science Slam. **Jessica Stock** was one of the co-organizers of this event, and designed the very creative and beautiful poster. 

Great job to all of the organizers for such a successful symposium!
