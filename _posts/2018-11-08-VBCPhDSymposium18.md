For this year’s VBC PhD Symposium – an entirely student-run event – students had chosen the theme ‘Metamorphosis – Transforming Science’. The event brought together scientists from various disciplines ranging from technology, communication, health and environment, and was a big success. It also featured the very first (hopefully more to come!) installation of Science-Slam talks. **Jessica Stock** was one of the co-organizers of this event, and designed the very creative and beautiful poster. 

Congrats to such a successful symposium!
