Today we said good-bye to our interns **Sarah** (Sarah Liedl) and **Auwal** (Auwal Tanko), who rotated the past months in our lab.
Under the skillfull mentorship of **Victoria**, Sarah and Auwal worked on research projects aimed at uncovering the mechanism of fertilization in vertebrates. They learnt a lot of new techniques and skills, from isolating zebrafish sperm and injecting zebrafish embryos to performing IPs and IFs, to presenting their own research.

We really enjoyed having had you in our lab and wish you all the best for your future career!
