Over the past five weeks four students of the Pauli lab joined Andi for conducting their own research projects in Woods Hole, MA, USA. The stimulating environment with plenty of interesting talks and scientific discussions, the openness of everyone and willingness to share and interact, and the amazing range of animals we could get our hands on (from sea urchins to sea stars, iconic horse-shoe crabs, cephalopods, and of course different species of fish) made our visit a big success. We are sad to leave Woods Hole, but also looking forward to our home-base at the IMP to put some of the new ideas into action!
