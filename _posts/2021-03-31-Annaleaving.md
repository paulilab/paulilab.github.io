Today we had to say good-bye to **Anna (Kogan)**, our post-Bachelor pre-PhD student who spend the last 6 months working under the mentorship of Victoria on Spaca6 and on developing a method to identify new factors important for sperm-egg interaction.
After some well-deserved break, Anna will be off to start her PhD in Oxford this fall!

We wish you all the best for your future career!
