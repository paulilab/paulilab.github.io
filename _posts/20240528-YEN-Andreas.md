Big congratulations to **Andreas** for being recognized with the 3rd prize for his talk about ‘the identification of a conserved fertilization complex that bridges sperm and egg in vertebrates’ at this year’s Young Embryologist Network meeting (YEN24) at the Crick Institute in London! 
Congrats to Andreas, and also a big thank you to the organizers of this entirely student/postdoc run meeting!
