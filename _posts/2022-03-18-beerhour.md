Finally!!

After a long break due to the pandemic, Friday Social Hours are back at the VBC!
Although not everyone was able to join (well, the pandemic is sadly not yet over...), those that could had lots of fun and enjoyed fishy puns, good (non-fishy) food and had a great time with our 'under-water party' going strong till midnight!
Thanks to everyone from the lab who helped to organize it and make it a big success!
