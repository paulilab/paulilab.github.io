Many members of the Pauli lab took part in the regional DevStem meeting, this year hosted by the UBB (University Biology Building). A wonderful day of top-notch science presented by the leaders of tomorrow (= PhD students and postdocs from institutes and universities in the Vienna area). AND a fantastic talk by **Andreas** from our own lab on the identification of a conserved fertilization complex bridging sperm and egg!
