It's been a very special day for the Pauli lab: Very proud of Sarah, the very first PhD graduate from the Pauli lab. Big congratulations, Dr. Herberg!
It's been an extremely productive and successful 3.5 years discovering Bouncer's function in fertilization. While you will leave us soon, your initial findings have opened up new projects in the lab that will surely keep other students/postdocs busy for the next few years...
