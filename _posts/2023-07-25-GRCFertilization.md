After a Covid-related gap of four years, **Victoria, Andreas, Krista and Andi** were excited to be back in person for the Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on fertilization and activation of development at Holderness School, New Hampshire, USA.
This meeting provided an amazing opportunity to reconnect with the scientific community, and allowed Victoria and Andreas to present their newest work on the discovery of a protein complex connecting sperm and egg membranes in vertebrates in the form of a platform talk, which turned out to be one of the highlights of this meeting based on the feedback we received!
And last but not least, we were finally able to meet in person with our collaborators Yonggang Lu and Masahito Ikawa from Osaka University, Japan, and catch up with old friends from the community and make new friends.
