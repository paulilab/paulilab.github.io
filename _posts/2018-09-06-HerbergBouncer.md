The first Pauli lab paper is out in Science! We report the discovery of a short protein that acts as the gatekeeper of the oocyte (hence the name 'Bouncer'). Bouncer is essential for fertilization in zebrafish, and - most remarkably - expressing a different species' Bouncer on zebrafish eggs allows the other species' sperm to enter.
Big congratulations to the authors Sarah Herberg, Krista Gert, and Alex Schleiffer (IMP/IMBA).

Thanks to our Tibor Kulcsar (IMP graphics) for the pictures and to Benedikt Mandl and Heidi Hurtl (IMP communications) for putting it together!
