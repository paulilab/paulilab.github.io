The Pauli lab laced up their running shoes and joined thousands of participants in Vienna for the annual **Wings for Life World Run**! In this unique race a "Catcher Car" chases down runners and all entry fees go directly to spinal cord research. 
It was an inspiring day filled with team spirit and plenty of laughs as we ran (and walked!). Thank you to everyone who participated and supported the Wings for Life World Run!
