The Pauli lab's first **virtual lab meeting** is in the books! With everyone working from home due campus-/Vienna-/Austria-wide to social isolation measures in light of Covid-19, this was a successful experiment. Thanks to Victoria for being our guinea-pig in giving it, and to everyone for joining in and actively contributing!
