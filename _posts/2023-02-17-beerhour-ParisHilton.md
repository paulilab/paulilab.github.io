Back to the 2000s - and Paris Hilton's birthday (on the 17.2.) - were this year's motto for our very special Pauli lab beer hour.
This involved getting a live-size version of Paris Hilton printed by our graphics department (thanks Tibor and Hannes!) and a photobooth with Paris Hilton, dressing up according to the 2000s, fun music that everyone remembered from the 'good old past' and lots of dancing from the entire Pauli lab!
It turned out a huge success - though now the Pauli lab is left with a live-sized version of Paris Hilton and has a new problem to solve: what do we now do with her (options range from putting her up in the lab or at the microscope vs trashing her)?
