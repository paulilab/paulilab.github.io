Something to celebrate: **Four ERC Consolidator grants** for labs of all four ViennaBiocenter research institutions, namely for Joao Matos (Max Perutz Labs, ERC CoG 2021), Nicolas Rivron (IMBA, ERC CoG 2021), Yasin Dagdas (GMI, ERC CoG 2022) and Andi Pauli (IMP, ERC CoG 2022)!

We took it as the perfect reason to justify an 'ERC-themed beer hour' and invited everyone of the ViennaBiocenter community for a heart-felt THANK YOU for all the help and contributions from lab members, colleagues, scientific facilities and administration.
This would have not been possible without the fantastic community we have on site!
