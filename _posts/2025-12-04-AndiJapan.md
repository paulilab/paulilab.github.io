**Andi** took advantage of the invitation to speak at the **Japanese Society of Molecular Biology (JSMB) Conference** in Yokohama and combined it with visiting two collaborators' labs in Japan:
**Masahito Ikawa**'s lab at Osaka University, which also led to an inspiring discussion with **Masaru Okabe**, Masa's former PhD advisor, and **Tomohiro Nishizawa** and **Yongchan Lee** at Yokohama University.
The conference in Yokohama brought about lots of unexpected opportunities to meet old friends, including Nadine Vastenhouw from Geneva and Tatsuya Nishino from Tokyo University, and make new ones with Japanese colleagues. It also demonstrated that (1) one can follow talks given in Japanese if the slides are well-prepared in English, and (2) one be lucky to find extremely interesting posters amongst 3000 presenters!
Overall, it was a fun and inspiring visit with having strengthened excisting connections and made lots of new ones!
