Big congratulations to **Theresa** who has been awarded a [VIP3 fellowship](https://training.vbc.ac.at/post-docs/vip3-post-doc-program/) for her studies on the regulation of protein degradation during early embryogenesis - a new topic in the Pauli lab. 

We are excited to see what you will discover!
