A very warm welcome to **Jörg**, joint bioinformatician between the Obenauf and Pauli labs!

Jörg is no newcomer to Vienna, having performed his PhD in Ivo Hofacker's lab at the University of Vienna, followed by postdoctoral work in Peter Stadler's Department for Mathematics and Informatic at the University of Leipzig, Germany. 
Jörg will be supporting multiple projects in the lab with his genomics and bioinformatics expertise, and we are very excited to welcome you back home!
