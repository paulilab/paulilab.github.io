We don't need a reason to meet up for a joint lab-dinner, but this time there were in fact three!
- to say goodbye and thank you to our 'fastest genotyper' Nina - you have made everyone's life so much easier by helping with the genotyping! Good luck and all the best for your future career in the office!
- to say goodbye and thank you to our intern Lisa - have fun in Boston at the Whitehead Institute for your Master thesis!
- to welcome our new PhD student, Frieda Leesch!
