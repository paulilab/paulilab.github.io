Time to say good-bye to two of our interns:

**Romane** completed her five-month internship for her Masters program with excellent supervision from Ida. **Aleq** completed his three-month internship as part of the VBC Talents-For-Future Program under the experienced mentorship of Victoria. 

We wish you both the best as you wrap up your Masters degree in the coming year!
