How does nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD) regulate ES cell differentiation? We are very happy to have been able to contribute to the discovery of a feedback loop between NMD and translational regulation via a truncated form of the translation initiation factor eIF4E2. 
Congratulations to the entire **Leeb lab (Max Perutz Labs)**, all collaborators and our own contributors to this interesting story, **Anastasia and Frieda**!
