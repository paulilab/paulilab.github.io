Welcome to our new interns Anna and Lisa! **Lisa** is taking over from Friederike (Schlumm) and will be in charge of our collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim. **Anna (Bandura)** is taking over from Mirjam and will be helping everyone in the lab with genotyping zebrafish. 
It's great to have you both around!
