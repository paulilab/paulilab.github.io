The Pauli lab was treated to an in-depth tour of the Haus des Meeres given by the deputy director and curator, Daniel Abed-Navandi. He taught us a lot about the different species on display, and gave us a behind-the-scenes look of how the aquarium operates. Some of the cool organisms we were able to see included a poisonous cone snail species, lots of little jellyfish, and the aquariumâ€™s thriving seahorse population.
