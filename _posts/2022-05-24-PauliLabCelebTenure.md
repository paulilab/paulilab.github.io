The Pauli lab managed to catch me completely by surprise: Instead of heading to a regular 1:1 meeting with a student, they had organized a surprise get-together to celebrate my tenure at the IMP with new Pauli-lab shirts for everyone and a fantastic photo-book with memories from the past 6.5 years at the IMP!  
I love my lab ;-)! 

A huge and heartfelt THANK YOU to my entire lab, for all your drive, hard work and motivation to push the science ahead, for bringing in your own ideas & creativity to shape your projects, for creating a stimulating working envirnoment where everyone can thrive, and for being such great people to work with and mentor. 
Thank you for trusting in me to join the lab in first place!
