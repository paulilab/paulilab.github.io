The Vastenhouw lab was visiting us here in Vienna ahead of the EMBO meeting on zygotic genome activation for a joint **Pauli-Vastenhow-lab** day of scientific exchange, discussing ideas and having fun!
Thanks to everyone for participating, whether by presenting your projects in the form of chalk talks or by contributing to the discussion. Special thanks go to Hann and Krista for preparing the zebrafish-jeopardy for everyone's entertainment in the evening (I thought I would know most answers but you proved me completely wrong!), and to EMBO YIP for providing funding for this joint lab day.
