Students from the HBLVA Rosensteingasse were visiting us today to get a glimps into working at an international research institute, and of course to see our zebrafish!
There were lots of questions and interesting discussions - thanks Karin for helping in answering all of them!
We had a great time showing you around, and it seemed that you enjoyed your 'lab-outing', too!
