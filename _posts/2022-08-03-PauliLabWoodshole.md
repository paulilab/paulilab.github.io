After two years of no Woods Hole and no US trips, Pauli lab members were finally back again in action at this year's zebrafish development and genetics course at the Marine Biological Labs in Woods Hole, US.
For **Frieda** and **Karin** is was the first time TAing at the course in the injection module that **Andi** tought together with Becky Burdine this year. 

While it was a wonderful opportunity to catch up with old zebrafish friends and colleagues, we also had plenty of opportunities to 'catch up' with our Viennese neighbors, namely members of the Gerlich lab and Manuel Zimmer who were at the same time in Woods Hole! Small world ;-)!
