After two years of no Woods Hole and no US trips, Pauli lab members were finally back again in action at this year's zebrafish development and genetics course at the Marine Biological Labs in Woods Hole, US.
For **Frieda** and **Karin** is was the first time TAing at injection module of the course that Andi tought together with Becky Burdine this year.
While it was wonderful to catch up with old 'zebrafish' friends and colleagues, we also had plenty of opportunities to 'catch' up wth our neighbors from the Vienna BioCenter, members of the Gerlich lab and Manuel Zimmer! Small world ;-)
