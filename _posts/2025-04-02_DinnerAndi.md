The Pauli lab recently enjoyed a relaxed evening of good food and great company at Andi's place! 
It was a wonderful opportunity to socialize and connect outside of the lab environment. Events like these are highlight the camaraderie and joyful spirit that makes the Pauli lab such a special and fun place to work.
