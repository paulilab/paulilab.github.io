We are very happy that our newly launched El Salvadoran internship program has been off to a great start! In June, we welcomed our first scholar, **Eduardo Isaac Martinez Barrios**, who is a bachelor student at the University of El Salvadore. This new initiative, namely to offer one Salvadoran student per year the possibility to experience and perform top-notch research in one of Europe's leading research institutions, was initiated by our very own Salvadoran postdoc **Victoria**. 

Over the past two months, Victoria has done a trememdous job in mentoring Eduardo - in fact so good that Eduardo asked us whether he can extend his stay for another month - a request we gladly accepted given that we could not have wished for a more motivated, eager to learn and truly interested first student!

It's been a wonderful experience for both sides - mentor and mentee!!
