When institutes had to shut-down during the pandemic mid of March, many scientists across the VBC campus joined forces to help to fight the virus. 
Over the past five months, **Julius Brennecke** (IMBA) and **Andi** (IMP) worked together with a team of three PhD students, Max Kellner (PhD student at the LMB), Jakob Schnabl and Julian Ross (PhD students at IMBA), to develop a rapid, highly sensitive and inexpensive isothermal SARS-CoV-2 test. 
Our latest push towards was geared towards making the reaction open-access - meaning any molecular biology lab in the world can now in principle produce the enzymes requied for the RT-LAMP reaction.
The whole work would not have been possible without our on-site biochemists Irina, Benedikt and Johannes, the continous support from our institutes, and our labs. 

Check out the latest preprint on bioRxiv: "A rapid, highly sensitive and open-access SARS-CoV-2 detection assay for laboratory and home testing."
