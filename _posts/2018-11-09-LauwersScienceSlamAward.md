Two success stories from the Pauli lab:

Congratulations to **Sarah Herberg** for winning the Mattias Lauwers Award 2018! Sarah was nominated by her fellow VBC students for the best Monday seminar presentation of the year. 

Congratulations to **Quio** (Luis Enrique Cabrera Quio) for winning the first ever Science Slam at the VBC PhD Symposium 2018! Among all of the great and creative contributions, Quio's dancing performance, "RNA Degradation: The Musical," sung by **Krista Gert** thrilled the audience and showed off amazing, hidden talents! 

Big congratulations to Sarah, Quio & Krista!
