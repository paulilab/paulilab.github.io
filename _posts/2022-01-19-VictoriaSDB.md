Big congratulations to **Victoria** who won the 2022 Society of Developmental Biology (SDB) Trainee Communication and Outreach award!
The award recognises the outreach and mentoring efforts of its junior members (PhD students or postdocs). We are super happy that Victoria was selected from the international jury for her many outreach initiatives and stellar mentoring of undergraduate students, both during her PhD at Duke University and now as a postdoc at the IMP in Vienna.
