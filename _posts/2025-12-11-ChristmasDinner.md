The Christmas season has officially arrived in the Pauli Lab, with Andi’s lab advent calendar and our annual Christmas outing! 

This year, we stretched the creative half of our brains during a festive pottery painting session, followed by mulled wine at one of Vienna‘s countless Christmas markets. We wrapped up the evening with delicious Korean food and exchanged Secret Santa gifts.
A wonderful way to celebrate the end of the year together - Happy Holidays from the Pauli Lab!
