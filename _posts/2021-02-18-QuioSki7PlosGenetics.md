Big congratulations to **Quio** and all co-authors (Alex Schleiffer, Karl Mechtler) on getting our Ski7-paper accepted in PlosGenetics! Thanks also to the constructive comments from the reviewers that helped us to improve the paper, and everyone else that helped on the way.

If you want to know more what Quio found, check out Quio's great [tweet-story](https://twitter.com/EnriqueCQuio/status/1363623484593700877) and read our [paper](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1009390): "Zebrafish Ski7 tunes RNA levels during the oocyte-to-embryo transition." Or - for anyone who wants to practise their Spanish - here is an article that was published in [Revista Ciencia](https://www.revistaciencia.amc.edu.mx/index.php/ediciones-anteriores/edicion-actual/308-resena/897-luis-enrique-cabrera-quio-un-joven-estudiante-de-doctorado-investiga-la-funcion-de-una-proteina-para-el-desarrollo-embrionario) about Quio's work.
