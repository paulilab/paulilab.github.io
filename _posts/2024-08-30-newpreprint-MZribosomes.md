New pre-print alert! 

In this collaborative study jointly led by Arish Shah from Eliezer Calo's lab (MIT) and **Frieda Leesch** from the Pauli lab, we investigated the previously described maternal-zygotic ribosomal system in zebrafish further. Interestingly, we discovered that (1) maternal and somatic subunits are compatible with each other and form in the embryo, and (2) maternal-type ribosomes are not only made during oogenesis, but are also generated in primordial germ cells likely throughout the life of the fish. Thus, the previously described dual ribosomal system extends to the germline of the fish, opening the possibility that it may control germline-specific translation. 
Big congrats to all authors!
