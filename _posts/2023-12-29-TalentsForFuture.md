Time flew past for our Talents-for-Future “Summer” students from Ghana, who spent the past 2.5 months at the Vienna BioCenter. In a closing Mini-Symposium all three students, **Martin, Victor and Sarah**, presented their research to us, and it has been amazing to hear how much they’ve accomplished and learnt during their time at the VBC. 
I can safely say that launching the Talents-for-Future program with our Ghanaian students has been a huge success. This program builds on **Victoria’s** successful initiative 3 years ago, where she invited a student (Eduardo) from El Salvador for a research stay into our lab over the summer. On a personal note, it has been fantastic to see our Ghanaian students grow as scientists and persons, and we could not have wished for a more motivated group of students: they were willing to dive into new research experiences and embrace our very different culture from day one! Their stay with us was topped off with a week of beautiful snow in Vienna (the first snow for our Ghanaian friends!), Christmas market visits and even some ice-skating that sparked real ambitions in some to become the first ever Ghanaian Olympic ice-skater. 
It has been amazing to have had you join us here in Vienna – thank you for being so openminded, kind and full of smiles, optimism and determination to reach your dreams of becoming scientists!
