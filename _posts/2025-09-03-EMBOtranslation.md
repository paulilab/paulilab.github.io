This week, **Ida** and **Josef** took the train to Heidelberg to take part in the **EMBO Translation Meeting**, en exciting conference bringing together experts in RNA biology and protein synthesis.
Josef gave a wonderful and well-received talk showcasing his work on the regulation of dormant ribososmes, offering new insights into how gene expression is controlled in different contexts, while Ida presented a poster with exciting first results on how killifish regulate translation during diapause, a state of suspended development that enables survival in extreme environments.
Both presentations sparked engaging discussions at the meeting, and back in Vienna they shared their new insights with the lab in a ‘What’s new in the translation field’ presentation. 

Well done, Ida and Josef!
