Our fertilization team – **Andi, Karin, Johannes, Victoria, and Andreas** – recently embarked on an exciting trip to Japan, to visit the lab of our long-term collaborator, **Masahito Ikawa** at Osaka University.
This joint visit was a fantastic opportunity to conduct experiments together, share insights, and strengthen the ties between our labs. We are incredibly grateful to Masa and his team for their warm hospitality and for making this such a productive and memorable visit - from organizing running sushi chefs and a special party, to teaching us not only all the tricks of how to dissect mouse testis but also how to say 'thank you' in Osaka (Ookini) and consequently earning big smiles in the street, to showing us how Japanese labs are kept so clean (each week there is a 'cleaning hour' where everyone stops their normal work to clean)!

Masa and team, thank you so much for everything!!
