Our fertilization team – **Andi, Karin, Johannes, Victoria, and Andreas** – recently embarked on an exciting trip to Japan, to visit the lab of our long-term collaborator, **Masahito Ikawa** at Osaka University.
This joint visit was a fantastic opportunity to conduct experiments together, share insights, and strengthen the ties between our labs. We are incredibly grateful to Masa and his team for their warm hospitality and for making this such a productive and memorable visit!
