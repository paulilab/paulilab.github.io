July was conference time: 
- Jessica attended the 10th European Zebrafish Meeting in Budapest, Hungary;
- Sarah & Andi attended the Gordon Research Conference for Fertilization & Activation of Development at Holderness School, NH, USA;
- Quio attended the EMBO Conference on RNA localization and local translation in Barga, Italy.

Lots of food for thought and interesting discussions, and great to meet new people and catch up with old friends and colleagues!
