A very warm welcome to **Lalitha Veleti**, our newest PhD student in the Pauli lab! 
Lalitha is not a complete new-comer to our campus though since she has performed her Master thesis in Clemens Plaschka's lab. For her PhD project, Lalitha is excited to explore mechanisms that contribute to the increase in translation during the first hours of embryogenesis.
We are glad to have you on board!
