Fantastic news from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle: **Victoria** was awarded the prestigious international **Harold M. Weintraub Graduate Student Award** for her "outstanding achievements during graduate studies" in Stefano Di Talia's lab at Duke University. Victoria will attend a symposium of Weintraub Award winners in May at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center to share her doctoral work. Big congratulations for this well-deserved award!
