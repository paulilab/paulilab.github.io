Four members of the Pauli Lab, **Ida, Victoria, Theresa, and Ezra**, joined fellow VBC PostDocs for a two-day retreat in Brno, Czech Republic.

The retreat kicked off with a visit to the [CEITEC Institute](www.ceitec.eu), where they toured the Institute's core facilities and exchanged ideas during a poster session. On the second day, the group explored the [Mendel Museum](https://mendelmuseum.muni.cz/en), gaining insight into the life and legacy of Gregor Mendel, the father of genetics. Beyond his groundbreaking pea plant experiments, the group discovered one of Mendelâ€™s lesser-known interests: meteorology. Fun fact: Mendel was the first person to scientifically document a tornado in Europe!

The retreat was a refreshing mix of science, history, and networking - a big thank you to the VBC Postdoc Reps (including Ida) for organising such a great event!
