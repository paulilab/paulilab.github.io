And finally - just in time to still celebrate together before Jessica would head off to the US for her postdoc - **Jessica's** Toddler paper was published in Science Advances! Big congrats to Jessica, Tomas, Friederike and our fantastic collaborator Edouard Hannezo (IST) for getting this finally out!
