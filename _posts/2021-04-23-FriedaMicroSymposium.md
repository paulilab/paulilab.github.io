This year's MicroSymposium happened virtually, yet featured international scientists from all over the world who enjoyed two days of discussing great science.
And in the end all participants voted on the two best PhD student talks: Big congratulations to **Frieda** who won the first prize for her talk about 'Storage and function of maternal ribosomes depends on conserved ribosome-associated factors' (picture credit to Benedikt Mandl)!
