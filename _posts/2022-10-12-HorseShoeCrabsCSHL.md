Andi, who co-organized this year's Germ Cells meeting at the CSHL together with Shosei Yoshida and Mark van Doren, brought back not only interesting new findings from 'everything Germ Cells' but also a 'special' treat for the lab (to the delight particularly of Hannah, Karin and Marcus): not sweets like usual but molts of horseshoe crabs that were super abundant at the local CSHL beach!
