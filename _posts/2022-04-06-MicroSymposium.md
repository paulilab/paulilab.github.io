After a year off and last year only online due to the pandemic, the Microsymposium on RNA Biology finally returned for an in-person meeting in the IMP lecture hall!
For most of us this was the first in-person meeting post-pandemic, and we organizers as well as all participants were very happy to not only share the newest discoveries but also interact with scientists from all over the world. The Pauli lab was scientifically represented by **Laura**, who talked about her newest findings on translational regulation during the egg-to-embryo transition. Thanks also to all helpers from the Pauli lab who helped in running the event!
