Ironically we had booked for our this year's lab retreat a hut in Corona (!!) - due to Covid-19 restrictions we had to change our plan last minute and decided instead to stay in Vienna for a day out in Prater. 
This turned out a lot of fun, with perfect weather, great science presentations and discussions about 'your dream future project', and fun games. A perfect opportunity for everyone to catch up with old and new lab members!
