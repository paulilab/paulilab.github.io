Ironically we had planned to go to a hut in Corona (!!) for our this year's lab retreat. Due to Covid-19 restrictions we had to change our plan last minute and decided instead to stay in Vienna for a day out in Prater. 
This turned out a lot of fun, with perfect weather, great science presentations and discussions about 'your dream future project', and fun games. A perfect opportunity for everyone to catch up with new and old lab members!
