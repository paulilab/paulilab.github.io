**Ida and Romane** went for a field trip to Brno and the lab of Prof. Martin Reichard at the Institute of Vertebrate Biology, part of the Czech Academy of Sciences. An amazing day of getting to see many different killifish (and other fish!) species and learn about the work in the fish evolutionary ecology group. We also brought back some diapaused embryos on peat of a different Nothobranchius furzeri strain â€“ soon to be happily swimming in our facility!

Also, be sure to check out the website of the Reichard lab and a small documentary made with a Czech TV team on killifish in their natural habitats!
