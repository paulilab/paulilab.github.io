A final lab meeting by our one and only **Jessica**. Jessica took the opportunity to look back at the scientific journey that led her to discover how Toddler really works and to reflect on the different stages during her PhD (1- Exploration; 2- Reality check; 3-	Enlightening; 4- The puzzle; 5-	The finish line). On top of it, Jessica provided valuable advise from a senior graduate student to everyone else in the lab.
While this might have been the - at least for the moment - final Toddler lab meeting, there will be a final chance to hear the full Toddler story again at Jessica's PhD defense - the finish line is super close!
