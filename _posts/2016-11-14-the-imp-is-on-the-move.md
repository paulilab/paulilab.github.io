The whole IMP is moving just around the corner (or in fact ‘across the bridge’)
to our new home, the brand-new IMP building! Fantastic effort by everyone
involved in the planning, organization and execution of the logistic
master-piece. 

A note on the side: The Pauli lab has the largest number of ‘members’ in the
new building - our ~5000 fish arrived happily in their new facility on the top
floor!
