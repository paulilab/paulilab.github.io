Big congratulations to **Josef** for winning this year's Lauwers Award for the best Monday seminar presentation in the past year!

The winner of this award is selected by their own peers, meaning fellow Vienna Biocenter PhD students, and presented to the winner by the Lauwers family at the PhD Symposium, which makes this award even more special. 
We are really proud of you, Josef, for winning this year's award and bringing it for the first time to the Pauli lab!
