What a wonderful start into the New Year with our Spaca6 paper now published in Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology!
How this paper came about has been one of the highlights of the past year: Under the fantastic mentoring of **Victoria**, two highly motivated and gifted students **Mirjam Binner** and **Anna Kogan**, who joined our lab to gain lab-experience during the time of Corona, took the lead not only on the experimental side but also in writing the paper. With biweekly zoom calls between Vienna, Finland and Russia over the past 9 months and additional help from Karin and Alex Schleiffer, our story about the requirement of Spaca6 for fertilization in zebrafish is now 'in the books'!
Big congratulations to all authors, in particular to Mirjam, Anna and Victoria for carrying this project through from A to Z and making it happen!
