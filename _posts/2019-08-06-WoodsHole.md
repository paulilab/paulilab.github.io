If you are a scientist and have been to the Marine Biological Labs in Woods Hole in summer, you will always want to come back to this buzzing environment full of eminent scientists and positive vibe :)
This year was a first for the Pauli lab to take part in the zebrafish course in three different roles: as 'student' (future postdoc Victoria Deneke), as 'TA' (current PhD student Jessica Stock), and as faculty (Andi). Irrespective of our role, we had a fantastic time!
