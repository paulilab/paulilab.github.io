**Sebastian** joins us as new Master student in the Pauli lab, having originally studied Biotechnology at [TH Bingen](https://www.th-bingen.de/) before getting a first taste of research during his bachelor thesis in René Ketting's lab at the [Institute of Molecular Biology (IMB) in Mainz](https://www.imb.de/), Germany. This is also where he gained first-hand experience in working with C elegans, something that will come in very handy for his Master thesis research in the Pauli lab.

During his Master’s research, he will be working with Johannes on characterising the fertilisation complex.
