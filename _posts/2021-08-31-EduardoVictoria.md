This week we also said goodbye to **Eduardo**, a Salvadoran undergraduate student who worked with Victoria this summer. Eduardo was the first student to take part in our initiative to provide a world-class research experience to a talented student from a developing country. We are extremely proud of the work he did in our lab and wish him the very best on his return to El Salvador! 
We are looking forward to keep providing a space for talented aspiring scientists to grow and flourish. Thank you, Eduardo!
