After a great recess in October, the symposia continued at the IMP with the **40-year IMP anniversary** back to back with the **Alumni edition** of the **VBC PhD symposium**. 
It was wonderful to welcome so many familiar faces back to the IMP and to hear a lineup of interesting talks and posters. Huge congratulations to **Josef** for winning a poster prize! Beyond the great science, a definite highlight was the alumni dinner at the Vienna Rathauskeller.
