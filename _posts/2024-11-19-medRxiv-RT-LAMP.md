New pre-print alert from the LAMP-team - the final piece of work of the team that formed during Covid with its mission goal to develop an open-source molecular diagnostics assay for nucleic acid detection for resource-limited settings.
And we succeeded! Not only in developing such an assay with simple home-made enzymes and reagents, but also to show that it can be shipped at room temperature to Africa for reactions performed there. This assay not only works for Covid detection but can also be easily adapted for other nucleic acid-based pathogen detection.
This work involved a large international collaboration led by our VBC-based students Martin Matl & Max Kellner and Felix Ansah from the WACCBIP in Accra, Ghana, coordinated by Andi, Julius Brennecke (in Vienna) and Gordon Awandare (in Ghana). 
Thanks to all contributors and the countless volunteers who helped to make it happen during Covid-times, particularly TrEND (Tom Auer & Lucia Prieto-Godino) for establishing the connection to the WACCBIP and providing funding for the African venture.
