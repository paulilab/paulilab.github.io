New pre-print alert from the LAMP-team - a final work of the team that formed during Covid and had from beginning on its mission goal to develop a completely open-source molecular diagnostics assay for nucleic acid detection.
And we were successful, not only in developing such an assay with simple home-made enzymes and reagents, but also to show that it can be shipped and stored at room temperature to Africa for reactions to be performed there. Moreover, it not only works for Covid detection but can also be easily adapted for other nucleic acid-based pathogen detection.
This work involved a large international collaboration led by our VBC-based LAMP-experts Martin Matl & Max Kellner and Felix Ansah from the WACCBIP in Accra, Ghana, co-coordinated by Andi, Julius Brennecke (in Vienna) and Gordon Awandare (WACCBIG Ghana). 
Thanks to all the other contributors and countless volunteers during Covid that helped to make it happen, particularly TrEND (Tom Auer & Lucia Prieto-Godino) for establishing the connection to the WACCBIP and providing funding for the African venture.
