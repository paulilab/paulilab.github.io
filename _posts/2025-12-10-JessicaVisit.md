Just before Christmas former Pauli lab PhD student **Jessica Stock** visited the IMP to give an Impromptu seminar on her fascinating PostDoc work studying the cephalopod nervous system. 
During her PhD in the Pauli lab Jessica discovered that cells are guided by a [self-generated gradient](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.add2488) during gastrulation in zebrafish. She has since taken this interest in developmental mechanisms to her postdoctoral work in [Carrie Albertin’s](https://www.albertinlab.org/) lab at the [Marine Biological Laboratory](https://www.mbl.edu/) in Woods Hole, USA.
Cephalopods, like the octopus, stand out for their incredible intelligence, yet how their nervous system is formed remains largely unexplored. Jessica gave an exciting talk about the many interesting questions her PostDoc has opened up and started to deliver answers for. 
It was great to see you again, Jessica!
