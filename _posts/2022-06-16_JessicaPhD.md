Immensely proud of **Jessica** for defending her PhD with flying colors - big congrats Dr. Stock for a brilliant PhD defense on Toddler's role during gastrulation! 
A huge thank you also to Jessica's examiners Lila Solnica Krezel (Washington University, St. Louis, USA), Roberto Mayor (University College London, UK) and Uli Technau (University of Vienna) for their insightful questions and discussion.
