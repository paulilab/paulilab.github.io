A lockdown project came to a very fruitful end: It's great to see our Annual Review in Cell and Developmental Biology about "The Fertilization Enigma: How Sperm and Egg Fuse" out online!
Big congratulations to **Victoria**, who was very much the brain behind this review and took the lead on writing! In this review, we 'merge' the current knowledge of the fertilization field, with a main focus on mammalian sperm-egg interaction, with ideas and concepts from cell-cell and viral-cell fusion.
We hope that this review will provide a fresh view on the big open questions in the field of fertiliation.

A [(not-yet-final) version](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-cellbio-120219-021751) of the review is already available online. 
Happy reading!
