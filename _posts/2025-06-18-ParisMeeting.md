**Victoria, Andi** and former Masters student, **Clara**, attended the “Fertility: Contribution of Maternal Inheritance” Meeting in Paris. Victoria and Andi then got to visit Clara’s PhD lab ([Alison Bardin](https://institut-curie.org/team/bardin)) at the Institut Curie. It was a fantastic meeting and a special visit to a former Pauli lab member.
