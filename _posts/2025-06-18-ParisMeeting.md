**Victoria, Andi** and former Masters student, **Clara**, attended the “Fertility: Contribution of Maternal Inheritance” Meeting in Paris that was organized by Elvan Boeke and Marie-Helene Verlhac. Watch the [talks of the conference here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jTQ_e84zG4).

Victoria and Andi then got to visit Clara’s PhD lab (Alison Bardin) at the [Institut Curie](https://institut-curie.org/team/bardin). It was a fantastic meeting and a special visit to a former Pauli lab member.
