In January, **Phyl** and **Vivien** joined the Pauli Lab to contribute as Research Assistants to ongoing projects.
Phyl joined us after working as a Visiting Scientist in the [Ries Lab](https://www.maxperutzlabs.ac.at/research/research-groups/ries) at the Max Perutz Labs. In the Pauli Lab, Phyl will use her experience in lab management and microscopy to help lab members with a range of projects and the daily function of the lab. 
Vivien completed her PhD in the [Zuber lab](https://www.imp.ac.at/groups/johannes-zuber) at the IMP, where she focused on identifying dependencies of pancreatic cancer cells using in vivo CRISPR screening. She will support team members with her extensive expertise in mammalian tissue culture, 

We’re excited to have both of you on board - a very warm welcome!
