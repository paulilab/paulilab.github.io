A little Pauli lab reunion in 'magic' Woods Hole: Super fun to catch up with former PhD student **Jessica**, who is doing her postdoc with Carrie Albertin's lab at the Marine Biological Labs (MBL) in Woods Hole on cephalopod neurodevelopment, in Woods Hole!
Krista, Andreas and I used the opportunity of being close to or anyways in Woods Hole (to teach/TA in the annual zebrafish course at the MBL) to catch up with Jessica and learn all about how difficult it is to inject those cephalopod eggs! Glad we only had to teach students to inject zebrafish eggs ;-)!
