A little Pauli lab reunion in 'magic' Woods Hole: Super fun to catch up with former PhD student **Jessica**, who is doing her postdoc with Carrie Albertin at the Marine Biological Labs (MBL) in Woods Hole on cephalopod neurodevelopment!
**Krista, Andreas and Andi** used the opportunity of being close by or anyways in Woods Hole (to teach/TA in the annual zebrafish course at the MBL) to re-connect with Jessica and learn all about life as a postdoc (and how difficult it is to inject those cephalopod eggs)! Glad we only had to teach students to inject zebrafish eggs ;-)!
