A very warm welcome to **Ida**, new postdoc in the Pauli lab! 

Ida did her PhD in Melina Schuh's lab at the MPI for Multidisciplinary Science in Goettingen, Germany, where she investigated the function of cytoplasmic lattices in mammalian eggs. In the Pauli lab, Ida will be studying the fascinating phenomenon of embryonic diapause in Killifish. 
We are really excited to have you (on top of killifish as a new model organism) on board!
