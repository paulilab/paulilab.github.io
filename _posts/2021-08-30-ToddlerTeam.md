The summer is coming to an end and unfortunately we have to say goodbye to our VBC summer student **Mireia Codina**. Over the last two months Mireia worked with Jessica on investigating how Toddler regulates mesodermal cell migration. During the final symposium of the VBC summer school Mireia gave an excellent talk and was one of three speakers to be awarded for her work and presentation.
 
It was such a pleasure to have Mireia in the lab, and the Toddler team will miss her dearly!
