A very warm welcome to **Johannes**, our newest PhD student in the Pauli lab! 

Johannes is joining our fertilization team, and we are really excited to have him on board since he will strengthen our team with his biochemical expertise that he acquired in Regensburg during his studies and also during his master thesis in the Vannini lab at the Human Technopole in Milan. We are glad to have you on board!
