Goodbye to **Jessica** with a final dinner and big THANK YOU for having been a wonderful lab member, rigorous and inspiring young scientist and teacher to new-comers in the lab! We will dearly miss you in the Pauli lab, but wish you all the best for your postdoc in Carrie Albertin's lab at the Marine Biological Labs in Woods Hole, working with cephalopods!
