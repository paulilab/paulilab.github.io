It's time to say goodbye to our one-and-only **Jessica** with a final dinner in Vienna. 
A big THANK YOU for having been a wonderful lab member, rigorous and inspiring scientist and patient teacher to all new-comers in the lab! We will dearly miss you in the Pauli lab, but wish you all the best for your postdoc in Carrie Albertin's lab at the Marine Biological Labs in Woods Hole, working with cephalopods!
