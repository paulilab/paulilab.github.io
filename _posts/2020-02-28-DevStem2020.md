Many members of the Pauli lab took part in the 3rd regional DevStem meeting, this year hosted by the IST. A wonderful day of top-notch science presented by the leaders of tomorrow (= PhD students and postdocs from institutes and universities in the Vienna area). AND a fantastic talk by **Jessica** from our own lab on Toddler signaling during gastrulation!
