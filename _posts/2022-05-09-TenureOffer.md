The big day: **Anna Obenauf** and **Andi** received the official letter of being tenured at the IMP!
While this was still kept secret at this point since we had not yet officially accepted the offer, we managed to take a quick picture of us not only looking like but being super happy PIs!
I am really excited to continue to contribute to the vision of IMP and the VBC in the years to come!
