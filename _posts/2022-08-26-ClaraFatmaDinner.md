Time flies! It's hard to believe that we will soon have to say goodbye to **Clara and Fatma**. Both Clara and Fatma worked on aspects of fertilization. Clara Veal-Phan joined us as a Master student from Paris and has been working under the direct supervision of Victoria for the past five months, while Fatma Afify joined us as a VBC summer student from Egypt and has been working under the direct supervision of Andreas for the past two months.
We wish you all the best whereever your future career will take you!
