The Pauli lab had a great time at this yearâ€™s **Dev Stem Symposium 2025**, a regional meeting hosted this time at the IMP and packed with talks, posters and flash-talks. 

Andi was invited as one of the two keynote speakers, while Nastya gave a talk sharing her latest results on mitochondrial activity during embryogenesis. Johannes, Isa, and Theresa represented the lab during the poster session. A great day of developmental and stem cell biology!
