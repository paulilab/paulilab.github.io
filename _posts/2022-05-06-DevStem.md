Our regional Development and Stem cell (DevStem) meeting was finally back again at the IMP with a day of exciting science and catching up with our friends and colleagues in the Vienna area!
This year we had a strong participation from the Pauli lab, with 5 posters presented by **Victoria and Clara**, **Theresa**, **Andreas**, **Frieda and Josef**, **Krista** and **Hannah** (mentored by **Anastasia**) (from top left to bottom right). 

Particular thanks go to the organizers of this year's symposium, Edouard Hannezo, Noelia Urban, Oleg Simakov and Martin Leeb, and to the Elling lab for organizing the social hour afterwards!
