A warm welcome to our new PhD student **Tobiáš**! For his Master's studies in [Petr Svoboda's lab](https://www.img.cas.cz/group/petr-svoboda/) at the Charles University in Prague, Tobias contributed to developing slugs as new model organism in Petr's lab. For his PhD, Tobias is ready to swap slugs for fish ;-) and will be joining Ida on the killifish team in the Pauli lab to uncover how diapause is regulated in these fascinating fish.
Welcome on board!
