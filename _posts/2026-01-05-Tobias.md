A warm welcome to our new PhD student **Tobiáš**! After completing his Master in [Petr Svoboda's lab](https://www.img.cas.cz/group/petr-svoboda/) at the Charles University in Prague, where he contributed to developing slugs as new model organism in Petr's lab, Tobias is ready to swap slugs for fish ;-). He is joining Ida on the killifish team in the Pauli lab to uncover how diapause is regulated in these fascinating fish.
Welcome on board!
