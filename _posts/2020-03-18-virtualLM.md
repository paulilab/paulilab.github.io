The Pauli lab's first **virtual lab meeting** is in the books! With everyone working from home due campus-/Vienna-/Austria-wide social isolation measures in light of Covid-19, this turned out a successful experiment. Thanks to Victoria for being our guinea-pig in giving it, and to everyone for 'zooming in' and actively contributing!
