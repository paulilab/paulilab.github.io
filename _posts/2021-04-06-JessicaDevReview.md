Big congratulations to **Jessica** on leading the write-up of this insightful review on self-organized cell migration. The idea for this review originated during the first lockdown in Austria about one year ago - one year later, being in our third (or forth?) lockdown, it's great to see it published!
Thanks to all the constructive feedback from reviewers and colleagues that helped us to improve the paper, and particularly to Katherine Brown, editor at Development, for making this publishing experience really enjoyable!
