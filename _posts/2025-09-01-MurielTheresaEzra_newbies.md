A very warm welcome to our three new lab members, **Muriel**, **Theresa** and **Ezra**!

The Pauli lab is growing with a new PhD student, Muriel, starting together with new PostDocs, Theresa and Ezra. Muriel did her Masterâ€™s across the campus in the Raible lab, where she studied bristle formation in marine worms. For her PhD, she will now be investigating the intricate mechanisms of fertilization in zebrafish. Ezra has moved across the pond, where he was studying in the Posfai and Shvartsman labs at Princeton, working on embryonic oogenesis in mice. He will continue to pursue his interest in germline biology, but now in the zebrafish model system. Theresa is joining from the cell cycle field, where she did her PhD with Paul Nurse at the Francis Crick Institute. In the Pauli lab she is going to investigate the molecular mechanisms regulating proteostasis during early embryogenesis.

We are really excited to have you all on board!
