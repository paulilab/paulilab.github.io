This year we headed to Eisenerz for our 3-day Pauli lab retreat to combine science, outdoor-activities, cooking together and some fun! Between kajaking on the Salza (to Andi's great dissappointment our guide did not manage to make us capsize, despite trying really hard), hikes and mushroom hunting in the woods, there was something in the mix for everyone. Particular thanks to Frieda and Josef for helping to organize this year's retreat!
