This year's VBC PhD Symposium **ReConnect** marked the 25th anniversary of the Vienna Biocenter PhD program. Alumni from all years had been invited back to the campus to join current PhD students to celebrate this special occasion. The diverse program included scientific talks by alumni, career workshops by alumni for current students, a reception at the Viennese city hall and a special '25 year VBC PhD program' tram, a VBC QuizShow, graduation ceremony and the VBC PhD student band 'the pellets' at the final party. ReConnect was a great success!
