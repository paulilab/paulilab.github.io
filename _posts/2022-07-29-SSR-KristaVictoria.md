**Krista** and **Victoria** represented the Pauli lab at this year's Society of Reproductive Biology Conference in Spokane, US. Krista was selected to present her PhD work on species-specificity of Bouncer in the form of a talk, which was a great opportunity to get feedback on this nearly finished story!
They were able to catch up with friends and collaborators from the fertilization community, including with our long-term collaborator Masahito Ikawa (who also took the picture of Krista and Victoria - thank Masa for sharing it!!).
