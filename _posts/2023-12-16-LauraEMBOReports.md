Big congratulations to **Laura** for getting her master-work on eIF4E1b published in EMBO Reports!
Laura led this study from start to end with key experimental help from **Marcus**, and several other lab members contributing. In this work, we show that eIF4E1b binds to the mRNA caps of maternal mRNAs containing short polyA tails. In contrast to its canonical paralog eIF4E, eIF4E1b does not promote translation since it does not interact with the key translation-promoting factor eIF4G. Importantly, eIF4E1b is essential for normal development of the female germline in zebrafish, and fish lacking eIF4E1b sex revert and develop into males.
