Once upon a time at the IMP…
On the 12th of January, the Pauli lab turned the IMP into a whole new world when holding their Disney-themed beer hour.
With princesses on cupcakes and a magical potion from Merlin’s cauldron, everyone gathered for the evening and enjoyed the bare necessities of life.
Hakuna matata!
