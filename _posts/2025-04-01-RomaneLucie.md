Welcome to our two new MSc internship students Romane and Lucie! Romane will work with Ida deciphering how dormant killifish embryos deal with shutting off translation, and Lucie will work with Amy on the impact of maternal age on developmental competence of embryos. 

Romane is doing a masters in genetics at the Université Paris Cité and Lucie is a master’s student in biochemistry at the Freie Universität Berlin.
