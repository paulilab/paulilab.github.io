We are really sad to say good-bye to **Marcus** who is looking for some new adventures!
Marcus joined us 2.5 years ago, initially on a part-time half-year contract to work with Laura. Yet since Marcus really liked it with us, and we really liked him both on a scientific and personal level, we were super happy to keep Marcus with us for much longer than initially planned. 
We wish you all the best for your future â€“ wherever it will take you! With all your skills in- and outside of the lab, we have zero doubts that you will find a new adventure that you will enjoy!
