Huge congratulations to **Ida** Jentoft for receiving not only the Otto Hahn Medal but also the Otto Hahn Award from the Max Planck Society for her PhD work in Melina Schuh’s lab at the MPI Göttingen! 
For anyone wondering (like us when we heard about it): the Otto Hahn Award provides some funding to support Ida’s postdoc time abroad and will allow her to establish her own lab after her postdoc at any MPI of her choice – what an amazing and well-deserved recognition!
