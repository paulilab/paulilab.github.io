**Josef** and **Andi** from the Pauli lab attended this year's [CSHL Translational Control](https://meetings.cshl.edu/meetings.aspx?meet=transc) meeting. It was an exciting trip, with Josef presenting for the first time at an international meeting his work on dormant ribosomes!
Five days filled with everything translation, ribosomes, RNA, structure and lots of interesting discussions and new ideas!
