And just in time before the end of the year we received the fantastic news that our postdoc **Amy** has secured an EMBO postdoctoral fellowship for investigating how maternal age impacts embryonic development, using zebrafish as a model system.
We are very curious to see what Amy will find out about this interesting new topic in our lab!

A big round of applause for Amy on securing this prestigious fellowship!
