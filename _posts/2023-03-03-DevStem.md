This year's DevStem symposium at the IST Austria brought again the broader Viennese science community interested in development and stem cells together. The Pauli lab was well represented with **Frieda** giving a talk on dormant ribosomes, two posters by our fertilization teams (**Victoria and Jonne**; **Andreas and Laurine**) and Josef and Jakob participating as well.
It was again a successful and very stimulating event particularly for master students, PhD students and postdocs to discuss about science, exchange ideas and get to know also other peers in the wider Vienna area and our new direct neighbors at the IMP from the Pinheiro lab!
