At this year's PhD symposium prize giving the Pauli lab had not only one but two reasons to celebrate: 
Congratulations to **Sarah Herberg**, the Pauli lab's very first PhD student graduate, for winning a VBC PhD student award for her PhD thesis, and to **Krista Gert** for winning the poster prize of the symposium! Well done and congratulations to the '2018 Bouncer-team'!
