A fun outing with members of the Pauli lab to try out our iceskating skills at one of the arguably most beautiful and special icerinks in the world - the 'Wiener Eistraum' right in front of the Vienna city hall.
As a special treat, our Pauli lab alumnus Krista, who happened to be visiting us, showed and taught us some special iceskating tricks. It was a fun evening out with some lab members showing exceptional perserverance and motivation on the ice until the closing of the icerink!
