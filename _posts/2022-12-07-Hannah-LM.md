Time to say goodbye to our Master student **Hannah**, who had joined us for the past year to explore the activation of mitochondria during embryogenesis, working under the direct supervision of Anastasia.
It was great to have had you in our lab, not only because of your motivation and scientific contributions but also for your positive energy and ability to easily connect with and bring together people. We wish you all the best in the future!
