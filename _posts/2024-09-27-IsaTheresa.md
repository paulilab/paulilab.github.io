Today we say good-bye to our interns **Isa** (Isabelle Sch√ºtz) and **Theresa** (Theresa Beunings), who spent the past three months rotating in our lab as part of their Master program. 
Isa was mentored by **Laura** and worked on the role of maternal mRNA binding proteins in regulating mRNA dormancy in zebrafish, while Theresa was mentored by **Amy** and worked on the effect of maternal age on translational fidelity in zebrafish embryos.

We really enjoyed having had both of you around and wish you all the best for your future career (and maybe we will see you back for your Master theses?)!
