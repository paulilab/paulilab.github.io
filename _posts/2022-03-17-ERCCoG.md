Congratulations to **Andi and the entire Pauli lab** for securing one of this year's 313 ERC Consolidator Grants (big congrats also to Yasin Dagdas from the GMI for making it two for the VBC campus)! 

The Pauli lab aims to use the 2 Million Euros of funding over the next 5 years to shed light on the underlying mechanism of fertilisation in vertebrates. A particularly focus will be on uncovering the molecular basis of sperm-egg recognition and fusion, with the long-term vision of  reconstituting a functional fertilization interface in vitro.
