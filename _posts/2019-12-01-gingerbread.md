LOTS of sperm, eggs, ribosomes, an exosome, mitochondria, fish, flies (and a ginger bread house as well)... Not the usual type of cookies you would think of for ginger breadk baking, but lots of fun and amazingly creative designs! Great team-work in coming up with a 'special cookie' for every lab member - way to go, Pauli lab, this was lots of fun!
