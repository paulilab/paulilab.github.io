Wednesday night saw model organisms gone loose in the Museum of Natural History in Vienna. The Pauli and Obenauf labs teamed up for a Xmas Scavenger Hunt as Drosophila melanogaster, Mus musculus, Ambystoma mexicanum and Danio rerio to take a picture with the scariest animal, rebuild the IMP logo and much more. 
Thanks to Manuela Steurer for the great questions that made this such a memorable and fun event!
