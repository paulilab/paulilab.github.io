**Laura** presented her newest developing story from her postdoc on the regulation of RNA translation during the egg-to-embryo transition at the EMBO meeting on RNA localization in Italy. What a great opportunity to get feedback on a 'story in progress'!
Thanks to the organizers and all conference attendees for the open and interesting dicussions!
