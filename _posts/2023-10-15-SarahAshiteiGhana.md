We are really excited to welcome **Sarah Ashitei** from the WACCBIP at the University of Ghana to our lab!
Sarah was selected as part of the new Talents-for-Future program of our Vienna Biocenter summer school, and together with her fellow Ghanaian students Martin Asare, who will join the Tanaka lab, and Victor Kornu, who will join the Penninger lab, will be with us in Vienna for the next 2.5 months. In our lab, Sarah will be mentored by **Victoria**.
We are very glad that we could finally get you and your fellow students here to dive into some molecular biology research!
