The Pauli lab was well represented at meetings which reflect the breadth of topics that we are interested (in a wider sense...) in the Pauli lab:
- Frieda represented us at the RNA Society meeting in Krakow, Poland
- Jessica represented us at the Society of Developmental Biology meeting in Boston, US
- Krista and Victoria (postdoc to-be), together with Andi, attended the Gordon Conference for Fertilization and Activation of Development in New Hampshire, US
- Andi was also presenting the newest on Bouncer and more at the Zebrafish Disease Model meeting in Boston, the Society of Reproductive Biology meeting in San Jose and at talks at Stanford University and USC, Los Angeles (thanks to Tonia Hafner and Oli Bell for hosting!).
I think it's safe to say that we have learnt a lot, got new ideas, had many fruitful discussions and expanded our scientific network (and met old friends on the way!).
