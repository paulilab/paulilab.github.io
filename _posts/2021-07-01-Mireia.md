We are very happy to welcome **Mireia**, who has joined us from Barcelona as part of the international VBC Summer Students program!
Mireia will be mentored by **Jessica** in our lab, and will investigate how Toddler regulates mesodermal cell migration during zebrafish gastrulation.
Welcome on board, Mireia!

General information about the VBC Summer Student program that is funded by the [Max Birnstiel foundation](http://www.maxbirnstiel.org/) can be found [here](https://training.vbc.ac.at/summer-school/programme-description/).
