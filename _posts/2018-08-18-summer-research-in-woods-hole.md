Over the past five weeks students of the Pauli lab joined Andi for conducting research projects in Woods Hole, MA, USA. The stimulating environment with plenty of interesting talks and scientific discussions, the openness of everyone and willingness to share and interact, and the amazing range of animals we could get our hands on (from sea urchins to sea stars, iconic horse-shoe crabs, cephalopods, and of course different species of fish) made our stay a big success. We were sad to leave Woods Hole, but are also looking forward to our home-base at the IMP to put some of the new ideas into action!
