New pre-print alert! 

Not only ribosomes but also proteasomes are kept dormant in zebrafish eggs!
Sascha Amann from the Haselbach lab discovered that the protein PITHD1 binds to and inhibits proteasomes. Together with **Josef** from our lab, they could show that proteasomes in zebrafish eggs are bound by PITHD1 and show reduced activity, contributing to protein stabilization in the egg.
We were very happy to have been able to contribute physiological relevance to this very interesting mechanistic story!
Big congrats to all authors!
