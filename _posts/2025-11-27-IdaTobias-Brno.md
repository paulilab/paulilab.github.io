This week, **Tobiáš and Ida** went on a day trip to Brno for the talk of [Jason Podrabsky](https://science.oregonstate.edu/impact/2025/07/researcher-and-alumnus-jason-podrabsky-to-head-integrative-biology-at-osu) from Oregon State University - one of the pioneers and enthusiasts of killifish research! Hosted by [Martin Reichard's](https://www.reichardlab.eu/) lab, they had great discussions about killifish, diapause, stress tolerance, and even killifish in space!
