While we have already been happily working here for a few months, today was the
official opening ceremony of the new IMP building with high-profile guests
including scientist Emmanuelle Charpentier and Austrian president Hugo van der
Bellen! Big thank you to Boehringer Ingelheim for the investment into hopefully
many more years of exciting science at the IMP!
