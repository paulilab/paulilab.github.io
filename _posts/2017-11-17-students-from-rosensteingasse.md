Students from the HBLVA Rosensteingasse were visiting us today to get a glimpse of working at an international research institute, and of course to see our zebrafish! 
There were lots of questions and interesting discussions - thanks Karin for helping answer them all! We had a great time showing our visitors around, and it seemed that they enjoyed the ‘lab-outing’, too!
