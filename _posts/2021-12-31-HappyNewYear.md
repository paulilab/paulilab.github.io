Happy New Year from all of us in the Pauli lab! Despite the pandemic not allowing us to interact with other researchers around the world as much as we would have liked and limiting our celebrations and social activities, it's been an exciting, fun and successful 2021. 

We are curious what 2022 will bring along!
