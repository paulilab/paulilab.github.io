And here the final paper-alert from the Pauli lab for 2024: 

**Andreas's** pre-print is out!

Andreas investigated sperm-egg compatibility in fish with a specific focus on Bouncer's receptor on sperm, particular Izumo1 and Spaca6. 
Given our prior knowledge on the species-specific behavior of Bouncer in medaka and zebrafish, our initial expectation was that either Izumo1 and/or Spaca6 would behave similarly. However, biology is often more complicated ;-), and Andreas's unexpected findings underscore the nuanced interplay between molecular restrictions and compatibilities during sperm-egg interaction across teleosts.
As Andreas very nicely wrote in the discussion, "a picture of evolutionarily constrained sperm proteins and a more flexible egg protein emerges."

Big congrats to Andreas for leading all the work and write-up from start to end!
