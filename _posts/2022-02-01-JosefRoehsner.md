We are very happy to welcome **Josef** as our newest PhD student recruit to the Pauli lab!
After having already worked at the IMP in Luisa Cochella's lab as a bachelor student, Josef is returning to the IMP after his Master thesis in Amsterdam to work on translational regulation (not only in embryos - stay tuned!!) for his PhD. 
We are excited to have you on board, Josef!
