Published in Nucleic Acids Research (NAR): a new collaborative paper led by Ozren Bogdanovic's lab with first author Sam Ross on the evolutionary conservation of embryonic DNA methylome remodelling in medaka and zebrafish. Thanks for allowing us, in particular **Krista** who provided the essential zebrafish-medaka hybrids, to contribute to this interesting work!

Congratulations to all authors!
