This week **Victoria** travelled to Innsbruck to receive the [Life Sciences Research Award Austria](https://www.oegmbt.at/awards/research-award) in the category Basic Research. She was honored for her outstanding publication, [“A conserved fertilisation complex bridges sperm and egg in vertebrates”](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867424010936?via%3Dihub), published in Cell.
This award-winning study sheds new light on the molecular mechanisms of fertilisation and represents a major step forward in understanding reproductive biology. The project was a collaborative effort, and Victoria shares first authorship with PhD student Andreas, whose strong contributions were essential to the success of the work. Congratulations to Victoria and Andreas on this remarkable achievement and well-deserved recognition!
