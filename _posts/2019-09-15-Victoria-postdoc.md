Welcome to our new postdoc, **Victoria Deneke**! Victoria obtained her PhD in Stefano Di Talia's lab at Duke University, USA, where she studied cell cycle synchronization in *Drosophila* development. In the Pauli lab, Victoria will join the fertilization crew to investigate mechanisms of gamete binding and fusion.
Welcome on board!
