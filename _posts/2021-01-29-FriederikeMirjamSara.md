Today we said a big and heartfelt good-bye to **Friederike (Schlumm)**, **Mirjam** and **Sara**. Over the past years, **Friederike** has been fully in charge of our collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim (zebrafish embryo toxicity assays) and on top of it worked on the analysis of cell tracking in the early zebrafsih embryo (together with Jessica). 
**Mirjam** started initially as our 'zebrafish genotyper' yet got really interested in doing some research herself, and under the fabulous mentoring of Victoria worked on the characterization of a fertility mutant in zebrafish. Mirjam is now off to perform her Master thesis in Finland.
**Sara** worked with Andreas on the characterization of another fertility mutant in zebrafish, and is now off to finish her Master degree at the University of Glasgow.

All the best for your future career!
