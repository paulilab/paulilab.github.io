Today we said a big and heartfelt bye-bye to **Friederike (Schlumm)**, **Mirjam** and **Sara**. 
Over the past years, **Friederike** has been in charge of our collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, and on top of it worked with Jessica on the analysis of cell migration in the zebrafish embryo. 
**Mirjam** started initially as 'zebrafish genotyper', yet caught soon interest in doing some real research herself. Under the fabulous mentoring of Victoria, Mirjam has worked over the past 6 months on the characterization of a fertility mutant in zebrafish. Mirjam is now off to perform her Master research studies in Finland.
**Sara** joined us as an intern in fall after having gotten to know the Vienna Biocenter Campus during her time as a VBC summer student in 2019. Sara worked with Andreas on the characterization of another fertility mutant in zebrafish, and is now off to finish her Master degree at the University of Glasgow.

All the best to all of you for your future career!
