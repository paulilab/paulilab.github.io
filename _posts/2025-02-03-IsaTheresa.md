After joining us for an internship last year, **Isa** and **Theresa** have re-joined the Pauli lab for their Masters theses. 
Theresa will work with Amy, investigating how maternal age affects embryonic development, while Isa is joining Nastya in exploring the regulation of mitochondria during early embryogenesis. 
It is great to have you both back!
