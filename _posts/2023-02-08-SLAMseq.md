And finally it is out! What took us quite some time, we are really happy to see our SLAMseq analysis during zebrafish embryogenesis published in Cell Reports. Using time-resolved RNA sequencing, we provide a comprehensive view of the embryonic transcriptome in a maternal/zygotic-aware manner in zebrafish. 
This work was a great collaboration between two PhD students in the **Ameres** and **Pauli** labs, led by **Pooja Bhat** from the Ameres lab with experimental contributions from **Quio** from the Pauli lab.   
Big congratulations to all authors!
