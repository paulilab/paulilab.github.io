And finally it is out! 
What took us quite some time, we are really happy to see our **SLAMseq analysis during zebrafish embryogenesis** published in Cell Reports. Using time-resolved RNA sequencing, we provide a comprehensive view of the embryonic transcriptome in a maternal/zygotic-aware manner in zebrafish. 
This work was a fantastic collaboration between the **Ameres** and **Pauli** labs, led by PhD student **Pooja Bhat** from the Ameres lab with experimental contributions from our own PhD student **Quio**.   
Big congratulations to all authors!
