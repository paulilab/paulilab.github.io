Big congratulations to **Laura** for getting her review published on 'The molecular mechanisms underpinning maternal mRNA dormancy'!
In this review, Laura summarizes the mechanisms in place to ensure that a protein is made in the right place at the right time. 
While these mechanisms contribute to the control of gene expression in all cells, they are of particular importance during the egg-to-embryo transition when maternal mRNAs must be temporarily stored and translationally repressed in the egg. 
Congrats to Laura on taking the lead on writing this review and getting it into its final shape!
