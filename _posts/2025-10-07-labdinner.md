With multiple people joining and the Pauli lab turning 10, there was lots to celebrate this month, so Andi invited the lab over to her flat for dinner and put her newly aquired cocktail making skills into action.  

We had a fun evening together, but need to meet again with more time to continue our cocktail tasting!
