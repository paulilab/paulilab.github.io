Immensely proud of **Krista** for defending her PhD with flying colors - big congrats Dr. Gert for a brilliant PhD defense on Bouncer's role in determining compatibility between sperm and egg in fish! 

A huge thank you also to Krista's examiners Carmen Williams (NIH, USA), Manfred Schartl (University of Wuerzburg, Germany) and Uli Technau (UBB, University of Vienna, Austria) for their insightful questions and discussion.
