Members of the Vienna BioCenter, including co-organizer **Andi** and Pauli lab members **Victoria** and **Johannes** as well as Maya Voichek (Brennecke lab, IMBA), had a blast at the first ever CSHL Cell & Membrane Fusion Meeting.
Four days filled with exciting science, discussions, fun, laughter and meeting new colleagues and catching up with old friends. On top of that, Victoria and Maya were also awarded with two of the three best talk awards, and best of all, we will be able to come in 2 years to CSHL for the second edition due to the highly successful first event!
