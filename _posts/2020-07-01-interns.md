A somewhat belated welcome to our interns Mirjam, Lena and Lorena! Mirjam is working with Victoria and already fully caught in the fascination of microscopy. 
Lena has been introduced by Anastasia into the powerhouse of the cell (and embryo), the mitochondria. 
And Lorena has most recently joined Krista to work on fertilization - and on what happens if two species that should not mate mate.
It's great to have you all around!
