A somewhat belated welcome to our interns Mirjam, Lena and Lorena! Mirjam is working with Victoria and already fully hooked on fertilization and microscopy. 
Lena has been introduced by Anastasia into the complicated life of mitochondria, the powerhouse of the cell. 
And Lorena has most recently joined Krista to work on fertilization, or rather on what happens if two species that should not mate mate.
It's great to have you all around!
