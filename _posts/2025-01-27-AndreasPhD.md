Immensely proud of **Andreas** for defending his PhD with flying colors - big congratulations Dr. Blaha for a brilliant PhD defense on the 'Mechanistic Analysis of Sperm-Egg Interaction in Vertebrates'! 

Andreas's PhD journey is remarkable: While his goal of the PhD never changed, naemly to identify the mysterious sperm receptor for Bouncer, he reached it in a completely different manner than we had initially thought of. 
Solving other interesting 'problems' on the way (the function of the mammalian Bouncer homolog SPACA4 in mouse fertilization, the function of the deeply conserved fertility factors Dcst1/2 in fish, sperm-egg compatibility in zebrafish and medaka), Andreas discovered that Bouncer's receptor on sperm is formed by a conserved trimeric complex.
For this main work, Andreas teamed up with Victoria, and together they could show that the too-good-to-be-true looking AlphaFold predictions of the trimeric complex binding Bouncer and thereby bridging sperm and egg membranes in fish were actually true. 
Andreas's PhD entailed an incredible body of work both in terms of impact and breadth of tools used, from zebrafish to medaka, mouse, in vitro tissue culture work, biochemistry and in silico structural predictions.

Thank you for all your contributions to our lab - you will be greatly missed, not only because of your insightful and valuable comments and questions at lab meetings! 
We wish you all the best for your future postdoc, whereever it will take you!

A huge thank you also to Andreas's examiners Ori Avinoam (Weizmann Institute of Sciences, Israel), Bill Snell (University of Maryland, USA) and Uli Technau (University of Vienna, Austria) for their insightful questions and discussion.
