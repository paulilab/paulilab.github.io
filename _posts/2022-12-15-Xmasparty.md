For this year's joint **IMP/IMBA Christmas party** at the Prater Alm, there were not only directors' speeches, food, drinks and dancing, but also a little 'special performance' by all PIs of the two institutes.
Though it's unclear whether the audience or the PIs themselves had more fun, it's clear that the modified 'Happy Christmas' and 'Last Christmas' songs were a great success!
