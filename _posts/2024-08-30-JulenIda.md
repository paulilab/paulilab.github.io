The summer is coming to an end and unfortunately we had to say goodbye to our VBC summer student **Julen Casulleras Alava**. 
Over the past two months, Julen worked with **Ida** on investigating diapause in different fish species. Ida and Julen formed a fantastic team, diving into this new research direction and performing together the very first experiments exploring translational regulation in our newest model organism, the African turquois killifish! 

While we will really miss Julen's excitement, curiosity and passion for science, we are 100% sure that he will do extremely well whereever his next steps will lead him. Julen, let's stay in touch, and all the best for your (bright) future!
