The summer is coming to an end and unfortunately we had to say goodbye to our VBC summer student **Julen Casulleras Alava**. 
Over the past two months Julen worked with Ida on investigating diapause in different fish species. They formed a fantastic team exploring this new research direction and performing together the first experiment exploring translational regulation in our newest model organism, the African turquois killifish! 
It was such a pleasure to have had Julen in the lab, and while we will really miss his excitement, curiosity and passion for science, we are 100% sure that he will do extremely well whereever his next steps will lead him!
Julen, all the best for your (bright) future!
