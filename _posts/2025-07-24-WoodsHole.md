This summer marked a special milestone for the Pauli Lab: after many visits to Woods Hole, **Andi** took on the role of co-director of the Zebrafish Development and Genetics Course for the first time. 

Incoming postdocs **Theresa** and **Ezra** learned the ropes of zebrafish research, from microinjections to transplantations, behavioral assays and live-imaging under the expert guidance of **Amy**, who joined the course as a teaching assistant, and established zebrafish faculty members and their TAs.
Beyond zebrafish, they got to explore the incredible marine biodiversity that Woods Hole has to offer, from catching pufferfish to experiencing the magic of nighttime bioluminescence.

And we even managed to have a little 'Pauli lab Woods Hole reunion' with former PhD student Jessica Stock (now postdoc in the Albertin lab at Woods Hole) and Victoria, who took the opportunity to visit before heading to the GRC!
