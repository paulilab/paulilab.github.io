Andi is one of the 28 international scientists who has been awarded the 2018 Whitman Center Fellowship to conduct research at the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, USA. This fantastic opportunity will also enable students of the Pauli lab to come along to work on their own projects and broaden their horizons at such an iconic place.
