This month, we raised a glass to celebrate a very special milestone: the **10th anniversary** of the **Pauli Lab**! Taking advantage of the late summer sunshine, we gathered on the IMP terrace to mark the occasion with bubbly drinks and delicious French pastries.

Andi shared a photo journey through the different stages of the lab—from its early beginnings in the old IMP building to today's group. A special shout-out goes to Karin, who has been part of the lab from day one. 

Here’s to a decade of science and to many more exciting years ahead!
