For this year’s lab retreat, we headed to St. Lambrecht in picturesque Styria. After we acquired enough snacks on the way we kicked the retreat off with a knowledge sharing session (thanks **Laura** for organizing!). 

The next two days were filled with hikes, preparing and presenting '700 Billion dollar' team projects, each of which would greatly contribute to solving global problems, freshly baked pretzels in the morning, an arts and crafts session and some intense games of werewolf. 

The highlight of the retreat was the first edition of the **annual PAULIs** lab awards – hosted in style by **Amy and Josef**, featuring awards from 'Best lunch-time talk' to ‘Most plasmids cloned’ and ‘Most GenZ lab member’.


A huge thank you to this year's expert organizers of the whole retreat, **Vivien, Phyl, Theresa B., Joerg and David**!
