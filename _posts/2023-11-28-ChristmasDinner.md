Great team work and lots of fun in solving riddles ensured that we all made it out of our Escape Rooms in which we were locked up (the bunker, the prison, or – very fittingly – the lab) just on time to get a Gluehwein at the Spittelberger Christmas market before dinner and our by now already traditional ‘White Elephant’ Christmas present exchange. It was a fun evening out with lots of laughter and smiles!
