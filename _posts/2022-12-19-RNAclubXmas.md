A trip to one of Vienna's local Christmas markets is already a little tradition of our **VCB RNAclub**, though in the past two years Corona did not make it possible. We were glad to head out this year again to Karlsplatz Christmas market to pick up this tradition, and enjoy some 'Gluehwein', freshly baked bread, bratwurst and waffles!
A big thank you to the **RNA Society** for sponsoring our VBC RNAclub over the past years and also this and the coming year again!
