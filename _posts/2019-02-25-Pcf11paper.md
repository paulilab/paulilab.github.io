We are very proud to have contributed to uncovering the function and mechanism of the transcription termination factor **PCF11** in vertebrates. This has been a highly successful collaboration led by **Kinga Kamieniarz-Gdula in Nick Proudfoot's lab** at Dunn School, Oxford University. Congratulations to all authors, particularly to **Karin Panser** from our lab who performed the zebrafish experiments!
