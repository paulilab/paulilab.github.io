From unicorn to pumpkin, witch, and of course Toddler & Bouncer - the Pauli lab had great fun with custumes for our very first **Halloween & pumpkin carving party**. Thanks Victoria for the invite, great initiative, Halloween-style food and expert pumpkin-carving tools which made it easy for us to go wild with our creative pumpkin carving designs.
