For this year's lab retreat the Pauli Lab headed to the Mariazeller mountains in Styria, Austria. 
Thanks to the contributions of everyone, we had a great mix of science, actitivities (visit to the famous Pirker Lebkuchen manufacturer and mountaincarts), hiking through Austria's 'Gran Canyon' (Naturpark Vorder√∂tscher) and to the summit of the Gemeindealpe and socializing.
And the question 'when will we have our next lab retreat?' when heading back to Vienna shows that this retreat was a success!
