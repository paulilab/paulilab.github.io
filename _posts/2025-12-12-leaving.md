The end of the year also brings new chapters, and today we said a heartfelt goodbye to several Pauli Lab members: **Laura, Amy, Nastya, Phyl, Theresa** and **Isa**. After sharing a delicious lunch together, we exchanged farewell gifts to celebrate their time with us, including custom-made shirts, photobooks filled with lab-memories, and a special “PI starter kit” for Laura, who is starting her own [group](https://www.imb.de/students-postdocs/international-phd-programme/apply-to-ipp/projects-offered/laura-lorenzo-orts) at the [IMB](https://www.imb.de/) in Mainz.
Thank you all for your outstanding contributions to the lab, both scientifically and personally. You have each left a lasting mark on the Pauli Lab, and you will be greatly missed. 
We wish you all the very best for your undoubtedly bright and exciting futures!
